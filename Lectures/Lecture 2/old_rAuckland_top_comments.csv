That might tell you whether the fence is along the legal boundary or not (sometimes it is not). If your neighbour is correct however, that doesn't entitle him to enter across your property. An option might be to give him a written trespass notice ([https://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/trespass-notice-form.pdf](https://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/trespass-notice-form.pdf)), in either case. You can deliver that to him personally (you don't have to wait till he comes on the property again), but keep a copy for yourself if you can, and make a note of when, and how you gave the notice to him. You can also upload trespass notices with the Police here ([https://www.police.govt.nz/advice-services/personal-and-community-safety/trespass-notices](https://www.police.govt.nz/advice-services/personal-and-community-safety/trespass-notices)) Then, every time he comes onto or crosses over your property, it's technically a criminal act. 

Agree with other posters that you should also film him coming on to the property. That footage (together with the trespass notice) will be handy if you need to escalate.

I'd have been sandwiched between them if I hadn't checked.

Be aware that more than one or two drivers up here seem to ignore the requirement to indicate when changing lanes and when turning. I'm fairly sure that's illegal, and dangerous.

Think everyone else is an idiot. Have room and be ready to evade. Allowing a margin of error means small mistakes by you, or other people, won't lead to something bigger. 

Like red lights. Don't stop right behind car in front, leave a reasonable gap just to make sure the car behind stops in time. Ease yourself to a stop with the brakes when you see unexpected traffic jam, the lights turn on even at slightst touch, so you give ample time for cars behind to stop. Don't go soon as it is green or the car indicate in the roundabout, make sure is clear; people run red lights and people have no idea what indicators do/make mistakes.

Learn the road. For new places, just be extra cautious. For familiar places, recognize the dangers and make room for it. The best way to drive is imagine yourself a motorcycle or a bike, where every accident could be fatal so you just do the utmost to avoid being in one.

Edit: Clarity. No one has the right to tell you how to live your life WITHIN REASON. As much as I hate being in lockdown, as soon as your way of living impacts OTHER people’s lives negatively, eg you can spread a disease with your careless moving around, or endanger lives with reckless driving, then you lose the privilege of free will. Any actions impacting more than just yourself you CAN be told how to live your life. And if you still decide to go through with living life YOUR way then you will have to deal with the consequences.

I think of social interaction like filling up a bucket. Lonely people have a nearly-empty bucket, and they *know* that their bucket is almost empty. They think, ""If I find one really good person, that will fill up my bucket.""

But that's not how the bucket works. One person can't fill up a whole bucket. There are lots of ways that go into filling the bucket.

People begin to fill up their bucket with small interactions, like with cashiers at stores, and security guards standing outside, with small pleasantries -- a mutual, friendly exchange. They fill it some more by meeting or chatting online with people who share a common interest, puzzling over the same problem. They fill it even further with friends and family, sharing their feelings and tracking events in their lives.

After all that, their bucket has a lot in it. When you meet someone like that they have plenty to give and are more comfortable, more self-assured, than someone without much water in their bucket.

Someone like that might nod and smile at a stranger on the street out of an overflow of goodwill that their bucket of social interaction has created in them. They won't be hurt much by being rebuffed because they know that they have a full bucket.

I've been at both ends of that scale, and when my bucket was empty I worried more about things than when my bucket was full. And I noticed that in filling my bucket, I met a lot more people in a lot more places than I had before.",1614852669.0,2021-03-04 23:11:09,/r/auckland/comments/lxglpi/saw_the_most_amazing_woman_today/gpmzv8y/,10

In general a physio will try to treat your issue, where an Osteo will look at your whole body as a unit. So you might think you have back pain but it might be deferred pain from a shoulder that is out of alignment. You unconsciously favour that shoulder and compensate with other muscles in your upper back, and now you are straining those back muscles making you think you have a sore back.

The above is all a true story, exactly what happened to my friend, he had a sore back for 2 to 3 years, tried many physios, doctors and osteos which didn't work and finally went to a good Osteo who took a look at him, spotted the shoulder issue, and FIXED him in 2 treatments.

I know with the first lockdown a lot of people were really reveling in the forced break kinda situation where everyone took it really seriously and it was new and foreign but now its familiar and exhausting and stressful and government support and I honestly feel like the community support has waned a lot. Auckland is also kinda stuck in this perpetual feeling of knowing that we're probably always gonna be the most heavily affected by lockdowns but also by the virus spreading due to pop density, location to international access and tbh, most varied levels of reaction to lockdowns...  


I myself changed careers in the early Season 1 lockdown from an outdoors role to an essential services role. I'm the sole income earner(not for long!) and I noticed it never really affected me because I work intensive hours on a regular rostered setting so for me, lockdown was almost making work easier but when I'd be home with my whanau, I noticed quickly the affect it was having on my partner and our tamariki. This is something that the whole world is going to be dealing with long after the virus situation is more under control. I also realised quickly when I went on annual leave that there was a clear shift in my own mental processing cos I'd suddenly be hit hard with big feelings about the whole situation, heaps of existential shit, bad habits returned after not having really touched anything since my teen years and just an overall feeling of helplessness. My saving grace fortunately was the fact that I'm fortunate enough to be able to attend and also afford regular Psychotherapy. I really hope that people who are also in a position to do so are able to as well as these thoughts we have and feelings that come up can really get out of control or become so repressed only to come back with vengeance in the future.   


Heaps of Aroha out there to everyone struggling at the moment. Remember to take a break away from the screens and the news every now and then as it gets real easy to just let your self senselessly scroll and continue to absorb information when what our bodies and minds need it to take a break.

He said it had been planned by council for 8 lanes + pedestrians & cyclists + rail. Central government - in their enlightened wisdom - said no, 4 vehicle lanes were ample. So the span was built for only 4 lanes for vehicles. But... the supports going into the seabed were built to the original specifications, hence why no further supports were needed for the clip-ons. Essentially if the supports are still structurally sound, then the span on top could be removed and a new one - bigger and with provision for pedestrians/cyclist/rail - built in its place.

1980s - Boomers got scared off the Share Market after the crash as many lost their life savings

2000s - Boomers got scare off Finance companies after many lost their life savings

Boomers talk amongst themselves, where can we safely invest now after all the peer stories of these losses.  Boomers start buying houses as investments

2010s - Interest rates are now so low, they are almost giving money away for free.

""Safe as Houses"" investment boomed \[pun intended\], and boomers bought even more houses.

2020s - No Capital Gains tax if you hold on to the house for 5+ years

Housing boom continues ad infinitum

NOTE: In 1999, House and Land price increases were removed from official inflation figures, removing arguably the biggest cost to ordinary people and renamed it consumer price index.  Meanwhile, house prices increases accelerated while official consumer price inflation decreased.  Therefore according to the Reserve Bank mandate to hold CPI down, by raising interest rates, they did not need to.  So with low interest rates, almost free money fueled the housing boom even more.  

Then compounding this, was a reduced supply of new builds due to ever increasing red tape for building, and high immigration, plus now returning cash-rich NZ ex-pats (due to Covid-19) we have a huge problem that will take ages to solve.

Meanwhile, rich parents are helping their children with money to get into houses thereby marginalising those families and children who dont own homes already to help their children even further.  As described in the book ""Generation Rent"", perpertual landed people continue and those without land stay without.

Sorry for the long winded post.  But I really feel for those people who dont own their own homes, because the future looks very bleak indeed.",1614239611.0,2021-02-25 20:53:31,/r/auckland/comments/lrnw24/congrats_auckland_is_the_4th_most_expensive/goomiln/,11

I don’t think there’s any easy solution she’s inexcusably failing to implement, but keen to hear ideas.

I’d like to see:
- Graded LVR restrictions. 10% government backed for lower earners, 20% standard for family home, 30% for a secondary home (Bach or exempted investment), 40% for any further investment properties.
- Investment properties must all be bought as a GST registered company.
- Can’t claim GST at time of purchase. Instead of claiming back 15% of purchase price to theoretically pay 15% on full eventual sale price, because these assets are often collected over 20+ years and not sold, should be no claim at time of sale and only pay GST on profit at time of sale. Ignore inflation. 
- Investment properties can’t be lived in to become the primary home again and dodge tax. Transfer back to private ownership can be instant but requires tax.
- Transfer of property from private to company ownership or back must involve GST paid on any profit between time of purchase or last transfer, however it last changed hands.
- Profit at time of transfer (i.e. no sale) is measured by an independent market valuation (e.g. Corelogic).
- Can’t claim back GST on depreciated property. If sold or transferred for a loss no tax required but nothing gained.
- (the big one) Mortgage payments on investment properties are NOT considered a business expense. GST mandatory on FULL rental income. This is the most important as the current system encourages investors to max out their lending, mortgage highly, so that they’re ‘not making a profit’ and not only don’t pay GST, but in many cases are claiming it back as a loss. 

That way, suppose I manage to buy a $500k home in a city, it goes up to $750k then I move out to the country for a lifestyle change where I can get a house for $250k. I’m not forced to sell and price myself out of ever returning to the city where I’ve left family and friends behind, by missing out on capital gains. I can rent out the city house and protect my future options.

But then I move to a third location, in between, wanting to buy a $400k home to live in. One of the other houses now needs to be sold. Can’t privately own 3 houses. So if I want to keep them I have to start a company.

Company wants to take over ownership of the first city house. It’s now worth $800k. To transfer ownership to my company I’d need to pay 15% GST on the $300k increase in value. $45k. Alternatively, the country cheapy, now worth $280k, would require $4.5k tax to transfer to the company. If I can’t afford either, I’m forced to put one house back on the market and sell it.

Suppose I don’t have the $45k so I keep that as my secondary home, my one exemption. I pay $4.5k tax, transfer the rural home to my new company and rent it out. I still have a $200k mortgage, $200pw, which the rent of $280pw covers. That $200pw is NOT a business expense. So I can’t write off that and find $80pw to spend on maintenance so that I don’t pay any tax. Or start claiming back GST for losses on my negatively geared business. $280pw requires 15% so $42 per week tax. Other business expenses can still get tax back as normal.

Now that $38pw will probably disappear into rates and general maintenance. But if I did end up with the company making a profit at the end of the year and wanted to enjoy it, I would have to pay it to myself from the company as salary. It would then sit on top of whatever other income bracket I was already on. Likely starting at 33c per $1. Just like any other additional salary. 

As a property company I am liable for spot auditing at any time to ensure I’m not stretching the definition of business expenses and am paying appropriate tax.

Under this system, people are free to invest in property, but they can’t blur the lines on what is the family home and what is a business. It would incur tax debt at regular intervals that many property investors simply could not afford and would then slow the house price increase and see more houses going back for sale. But it wouldn’t screw over the single home or home + bach owner or family shifting between small town and city living. The easing of the market should free up things for first home buyers, as would the broader allowance for 10% deposits for low earners.",1614222572.0,2021-02-25 16:09:32,/r/auckland/comments/lrnw24/congrats_auckland_is_the_4th_most_expensive/gonw9lb/,7

She is also leader for New Zealand and not just Auckland, so selecting Auckland house prices and not Christchurch (which doesn't appear in that top ten list) seems highly selective. Maybe lets not entirely blame Jacinda - the idea of capital gains tax - which I am in favour of, was shot down by large groups of the political spectrum. 

The source for this data is also a pretty right wing think tank (Demographia Housing Survey). Their solution for house prices is to allow sprawl, so that wealthy developers can buy up cheap farm land (if they haven't already) sell off cheap housing and and then let somebody else - the public via the council normally,  to deal with the infrastructure nightmare.

Instead we ignorantly force developers to restrict heights at the behest of these rich folk to hold generations ransom. It's basic math, if you take a $10m block of land and only allow a 4-6 floor apartment, those prices are going to be sub $1m (for a 2bd), but if you don't pander to NIMBYism, you can build 15, 20, 30... storeys and get the housing outcomes people actually want and those that still want their own backyard can access that with the basic trade-off of proximity to the city.

1313,Its getting silly now...,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_ls35xy,gos5sl8,stormdressed,"Here's the plan: we add a Land Utilisation tax.

Land is designated for a particular purpose at either a regional or national level. If you own land in a 'Residential' area, it must be used as *your* residence or you pay a tax for not utilising it as intended. This isn't a hard restriction but rather a tax in the 'lets raise the cost of doing bad things to discourage them' bucket, like smoking or producing carbon

As an individual you may designate one property as a primary residence and one as a secondary (no complaining about baches, granny flats or long distance commuter shoe box apartments, should you be fortunate enough to own them). Personally I think one is fine but it is understandable to have two and has been common enough in history for the well-to-do. Examples being summer vs winter homes, city vs countryside retreat, home vs bach etc

Any other property you own is subject to tax based on the value of the land. You are not using it correctly in the public interest so you pay for using it for your own self serving ends. This includes rentals you own, as landlords actually aren't the pillars of the community, they are obstacles in the way of people being able to curate their own piece of the country, or to form stable communities around where they live. 

Your 'additional' properties are also subject to a capital gains tax which dates back a maximum of ten years. If your grandparents owned a house for 60 years, we aren't digging out the receipt in pounds and sixpence. Taxing the differential on the last ten years is fine. 

Let's get to the goal of people owning their own homes and staying longer in one place for raising kids, knowing your neighbours and being connected to your community.",1614304634.0,2021-02-26 14:57:14,/r/auckland/comments/ls35xy/its_getting_silly_now/gos5sl8/,6

Commodity markets are erupting which means the price of everything you eat, wear, or drive is about to go through the roof. So think of these as the good times when you at least had the illusion of being able to save something even though it had no chance of matching inflation on hard assets.

People have the explanation for all this backwards.

The value of things is not increasing, the value of the currency used to buy those things is rapidly decreasing. Its being debased to hell by thieving central bankers. The US M1 money supply increased 75% last year.  That means 75% more dollars chasing the same number of assets.

So this notion that you can drop the house price is BS. You can't do it without a massive monetary contraction, which would drive up interest rates and credit defaults due to the insane amounts of leverage people, companies and governments have taken on - think 2008 GFC on steroids. Collapsing that would create the mother of all global recessions - in which case you couldn't afford to buy a house anyway because you wouldn't have a job and be struggling to find something to eat.

Why do think bitcoin is 50K USD? It's because no one in their right mind would hold fiat currency. They'd rather have it on a block chain backed by nothing, than in a bank where it gets stripped mined of value every single day.

And a few million people voting means nothing, when 20 unelected central bankers get to sit in a room one sunny afternoon and decide how much money ""their nation"" is going to print.

You're not living in democracy, so don't bother looking to a DJ PM to sort this mess out. She's just a smiling, ineffective puppet, you're a slave, hyper-inflation is on it's way and no-one cares.

1384,Sandy’s Parade at Laingholm,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_lr13al,goklcj7,Western_Product_4554,"Just fell off my seat reading this. I grew up in Laingholm from the age of 6 in the early sixties. Went to Laingholm Primary, helped print the first editions of the ""Roundabout"", worked in the Beach shop as a bread round boy in the mornings, and delivered the Auckland Star on my pushbike from the beach to the end of Laingholm Drive in all weathers. Made one Pound a week! Went to Sunday school at the Baptist Church. Helped Mrs Tilton the Post Mistress refill the stamp machine in the old post office which of course then became the takeaway. Lived in three different houses on Western Rd. Us kids would catch the Commercial Buses Bedford bus from the beach to Laingholm Primary at Central. There were some really tight and steep corners on the loose metal road on Victory Rd,  and on more than one occasion on wet mornings the bus would get stuck and the driver would ask us all to get out and get behind the bus and push. Can you imagine how that would go down today? But we just thought it was fun. We were muddy little barefoot urchins for the rest of the day at school and just happy we had got the bus moving again and didn't have to walk all the way to school!!

But maybe the best reminiscence I can share is related to Sandy himself after whom the parade is named. He used to live in in old house boat in the creek by  the bridge on the parade. As rat bag kids we would throw stones on his roof and he would come out and shout at us and wave his walking stick like some mangrove Taniwha. We would shout back then run away  in mock fear as though he would chase after us. We always made up stories that Sandy would beat you up if he caught you so you had to run fast!  One day, I walked to the shop and sat on the  seat out front waiting for the next bus to arrive. I used to ask the drivers if I could sweep the bus for them. They were more than happy and they showed me how to open and close the doors from the outside and they would go and sit on the beach with a pie from the store and a cigarette. They all knew I would keep any change I found as payment. It was that and searching for refund bottles in the drains that supported my lollies and ice block habit!!  One day I did find a 10 shilling note but  handed it to the driver. It was far too much money for a young lad to have. But I digress. While sitting on the seat, waiting for the bus, a man came out of the shop and sat down beside me. It was Sandy and I froze like a possum in headlights. I was terrified. And then he said...""you're one of lads that throws stones on my roof aren't you?""  Resistance at this point was futile and I confessed. He then said a few words to me about how that wasn't very nice and about how he had to often fix the holes in his rusty roof to stop the rain coming in. I promised I wouldn't do it again. He then sat and chattered to me about the beach, his wife who had died and some other small talk that made me feel he wasn't so bad after all. A few days later our little brat group were playing bullrush on the beach when a couple of the lads said, let's go and throw stones on Sandy's roof. I never said I had met Sandy but as forceably as I could I said that was not a good idea and that we ruining his roof so that the rain will get in. I was ignored of course and they threw rocks anyway but I didn't go with them or ever do that again. It seems something must have struck a chord and soon after that none of them were doing it anymore either. It was like  all of us had suddenly got a conscience and realized the consequences of our thoughtless actions. 



TLDR.  I knew Sandy. He was a great man. A better man than I will ever be.

Problem: People are discriminating against certain breeds of pets.

Solution: Ban discrimination based on breed. 

Outcome: NO PETS ALLOWED




Problem: Blacks dont make as much money as whites at their jobs. 

Solution: Enforce a minimum wage. 

Outcome: People with no experience are not worth paying the minimum wage for so they are now unemployed.(including blacks)




Problem: Housing not warm enough. 

Solution: Madate warming standards in rentals. 

Outcome: Price of housing goes up. People who can't afford the new, warm housing have to live in their cars or in uninsulated garages.


Please dear God, let me never be helped by a leftist.

“Of all the tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.  It may be better to live under robber barons than under the omnipotent moral busybodies.  The robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.” - C.

Many local healthcare place set up for small ops can do them, but figured that going to doctors who specialize would be better. 

Personally would go to somewhere close as long ride home afterwards.. not recommended. 

And get the follow up test to ensure that hubby is shooting blanks before dropping your guard. Somebody I work with got the snip, never followed up as it was supposedly 100% effective. He is now pushing 50, and has a couple of kids in their twenties, and proud dad to a young baby...

My story: we had a couple of young kids + bad miscarriage event, so wIfe was advised to not have any more. We talked about and I decided to pull the pin as being the easiest option. 

I noticed a clinic close to work in Milford, so popped in one Monday lunch time, found out about the procedure & booked in for the Friday lunch time. Walked around the corner and had it done. 

Seriously only about 15m and mild discomfort using a local anesthetic - no worse than a dental checkup and less painful than a filling. I walked back to work but after a while decided to bale out of work. So climbed onto the motorbike and rode the 30km home.

Kowhai - very diverse and inclusive environment, relaxed and low-key, teachers and students typically have decent relationships, most teachers very caring and friendly, behaviour especially from year 8s can be pretty poor

Auckland Normal Intermediate - very individualised, children are expected to be self motivated and aren't checked up on a lot, some children fall through the cracks because of this, typically children are well behaved, high staff turnover 

Intermediates are typically kinda shit tho, parents, teachers and students just don't care cos it's only two years.

Best thing I'd recommend is visiting the schools and if you can, try and speak with the parent groups/committee and voice what your looking for in a school and what your values are and how the school can cater for that. For example, academic pursuit for the sake of it being used as a tool of measuring an  individuals success is incredibly important to some people. For my family, it wasn't. We're more interested in meeting the individuals needs and desires in helping to support and nurture them so they can feel empowered to find these things out for themselves. I understand for many that approach seems very eerie fairy but that's just my family :) I can understand people that want academics as the main focus, wanting their children to be pushed too but its really worth investigating. Also, although it is 21 years of your child's life, its quite a transitional period and worth considering their own feelings around what school might be a good fit :).

There were two car parks on campus, the big one you see along Akoranga Dr and a smaller one closer to the intersection of Akoranga and the motorway on/offramps, if you go towards the main entrance, you turn right just after the intersection with Warehouse Way and go along the old building til the end.

Parking can be a bit hectic during the day, and many students park on Akoranga Dr and the surrounding suburban streets. But if your classes are at stupid o'clock, or if you don't mind turning up at stupid o'clock and make a full day out of being on campus then it's more than enough. Parking was \~$8 for a full day IIRC, so be prepared to fork out maybe $10 just to be safe.

In the spirit of Greta I also strongly recommend you taking the bus, the Northern Express bus stops at Akoranga Station and it's just an overpass away.",1614039490.0,2021-02-23 13:18:10,/r/auckland/comments/lot0el/parking_at_aut_north_campus/goeikhw/,3

Beautiful day yesterday for riding so assume that crash was not due to environmental conditions. Going to assume it must have been a nose to tail accident?

The bridge is a high wind zone so some days can be awful; when you are on a slim  200kg vehicle that catches the side winds.. have crossed the bridge hugging the tank before. You have to position bikes carefully. 

The bridge also had a couple of expansion joints which feel slippery when you on a bike. That and coming off the bridge people are shocking at drifting lanes without indicating or looking.

The added benefit is that the grass will look really good since the same area gets cut often and the clippings will help mulch the grass.

Two trains were there on either side of the platform, both saying they were going to Papakura. I asked the security guard working there who smiled and said ""the whole world is going crazy"", which is acceptable, considering AT and how abominable their handling of public transport in Auckland has been, he may have cared, but his higher-ups sure don't.  The higher ups of Auckland don't seem to care and aren't available for feedback or communication, or accountability for that matter. They are cliqued up and connected class-wise with the right people, binge-drinking on Fridays at the right pubs with the right people, with the right surnames, who they went to the right schools with.  Complaints also get lost in translation as the employees can be from  168 different countries and no one knows anything.  AT needs to fail so an outfit far more capable can take the reins or be reshuffled and replaced from the top down, with a classist fare system essentially charging anyone from less desirable parts of Auckland exorbitant prices to get to other parts of Auckland. Buses outdated, rattling, and noisy, compared with the fleet from Wellington and CHCH, and Particularly south Auckland buses. The trains which were hyped-up as the much-needed upgrade were disappointingly poorly designed, takes forever for the doors to open because they had to make them so fancy for some reason.... The CULTURE of posh upper class connected Brito-Kiwis(who binge-drink every Friday) combined with recent immigrants doesn't exactly make for the ideal public transport culture. CEO of AT ; private boys school educated, old boys network, probably never ridden his own public transport ever. Auckland boasts as ""one of the most liveable cities in the world"", but is far from it with piss-poor, substandard public transport which is both costly and unreliable, often late.",1613703993.0,2021-02-19 16:06:33,/r/auckland/comments/ln2mkz/auckland_transport_we_will_reduce_train_frequency/gnyrq1n/,22

There's a guy on trade me called Feroz who seems very nice mahogany.

Timspec has some interesting things like walnut, maple, redwood, blackwood etc but their prices are very high and you typically have to buy either by the whole plank (3m+) or by the pallet. They don't sell short stuff if you're only looking for a single piece for a project.

Rosenfeld is also good but same as above, expensive, and you need to buy a lot.

Basically there is no single one stop shop for getting decent wood at the size you need. I have found the guys at south Pacific to be the most accommodating and helpful and the guys at timspec officially couldn't give a fuck if you're there or not, they've always acted like a customer in their shop was a massive inconvenience whereas the guy at SP would happily move pallets aside so I could look at the one piece that caught my eye on a stack (I was looking for a specific guitar fingerboard for a customer who had some wantsas to colour and figure), which took about 30 minutes for a $18 purchase but he helped me out all the way.",1613767808.0,2021-02-20 09:50:08,/r/auckland/comments/ln8m37/anyone_know_where_a_good_place_to_buy_exotic/go1q851/,5

Sometimes I really just prefer a curry and beer rather than anything too fancy, but for wedding anniversary every year we tend to push the boat out and ignore the cost on the menu. 

Really hit and miss though; most expensive meal in my life (at least that I paid for rather than a company account) was a degustation at the French Cafe, that I didn't enjoy as was just too OTT. Though not to diss the place as have had fantastic food there, just sometimes you just want something bit more simple. Can also be affected by others.. people I was with that night didn't drink and were fussy eaters.

Also places change over time; so although one of my best meals in Auckland was at The Grove, it was more than 10 years ago. 

So my pick would be (in no particular order):

The Engine Room in Northcote point. Went there again for Valentine's this year. Great date night place as theatre across the road. Park the car down the road and walk down to the beach or under the bridge, Stafford Street wine bar for pre-dinner drink. We live on the shore so easy to get to.

Baduzzi. Been there a couple of nights but not recently. Wandering around Wynard Quarter one warm night, ordered a Martini which I am pretty sure the bar tender poured by the pint.. one Martini later, the night went by in a hazy buzz, but been back since and always good.

Cassia, Fort Lane. Had to book weeks ahead for our birthdays but service, food and the basement vibe was amazing. Pre dinner drinks at Jeffersons so basement to basement underground vibe.

And have to mention a few others which I have done a couple of times or more and had good meals:

Botticelli (Takapuna), Paper Moon, Giraffe, Monsoon Poon, Mezze bar, Soul Bar, Federal St deli...

However Council can be very particular with location and the removal of street trees, which makes things harder. Generally if you're paving outside the tree's dripline you should be ok.

Removing a tree would likely be a large headache (not necessarily impossible though), but to design around them (if possible) would be a much better approach.

Japan population: around 126 million. 

Japans' infrastructure without a doubt is 100x better than New Zealands'. 

You may think NZ is overpopulated and it's your opinion to believe so, a lot of people around the world or in NZ might think its underpopulated and they move overseas where more people/things are. Is it possible to make these 2 different groups happy at the same time? 

If you stop immigration, your economy is gonna plummet because people that immigrate to NZ work on high end jobs and improve NZ's economy. When your economy gets worst more Kiwis will move overseas where better economy is for example: Aus.

I made a dramatic rescue of a Shag once, while kayaking. It had a wing all caught up in someone’s fishing net. Exhausted, scared, confused, it had spun itself into a mess.

One friend stayed with it, already going dark and tide lowering to mud, while I rushed back to our car for a headlamp and box cutter, came back out and carefully cut it free. Had to hold it on my kayak to do so and afterwards it just stayed put. Couldn’t fly. Stood up on the high point of the cockpit (skirted sea kayak), shat all over the skirt to say thanks, pointed its nose into the wind and we paddled back into the now muddy shore, up to our knees getting oyster cuts as we dragged the boats out and this Shag stayed on top.

We did some googling then dropped it into an after hours animal shelter in Mt Albert. We were able to hold this thing like a cat on our laps in the car. Seemed at peace with us. Or resigned to whatever fate had for it after the time stuck in the net. I like to think it trusted us though, after the rescue.

Phoned the next day for an update and they advised they’d put it down...

Apparently it’s leg was damaged too and as far as they were concerned, if the animal is in pain, it’s better off dead. No doubt they’d take a different view for pets or endangered species, where the pain would be worth it for them to continue their species. But there are Shags galore. And no shortage of Pukekos... They’ll likely kill it and call it humane.

If I’d had a different home situation back then I would have liked to have kept and nursed the Shag myself. Just wasn’t around enough to look after it.

Each one is entirely different from the other (he just said he couldn’t be fucked ever being an environmental engineer as that doesn’t float his boat and some people embrace it) .. so for longer term enjoyment it’s best to go with what you have a higher level of interest in.

Pay is about the same across the specs too, as your pay its more dependent on the company you work for instead of specialisation.

Take the 3rd year structural papers only if you really enjoy structures. They are quite tough papers, even for those with a passion for structures. Since pay/demand is pretty similar across specs, use 3rd year, and maybe even 4th year, to just figure out what you enjoy most.

Regardless of whatever papers you take in the next 2 years, your career is not locked to that. I took Structures 2 and 3 in third year, hated both of them, took geotech and transport in 4th year, graduated, and ended up working in project management instead.

I graduated from Auckland with a BE(Civil) with a focus on environmental engineering.
I have worked in traffic (client and contactor), been a consultant in 3 waters horizontal infrastructure (read: pipes) and water treatment plants, and am now a consultant advisor doing a variety of things covering risk management, design management, procurement, delivery models, etc.

This is to say that frankly it doesn't matter what you focus on for your studies - your career prospects are absolutely fine regardless.

What I would say is that while all disciplines work together on projects, I would group the four disciplines as follows: transport/water and structural/Geo as these combo have the most interplay between them.

I read an NZ property investment book in the Nineties stating property doubles in value every 7 years and there was data to prove it. I still found it hard to imagine at the time. but I look back at my first home then (and yes deposit was huge for the time) and they have continued on that trajectory. it hasn't speed up at all its tracking the same. this article from last year shows the same. 50 years of data does not lie. people just need to stop spending money on things such $1000 phones. Plus you can't expect to buy a house as the same standard as you would rent. It's tough but still possible if you change your life style.

This is a really shit spot to be in but the blacklisting process was brought in because it became a massive hole for dodgy shit. Best bet would be disputes tribunal tbh. VF are within their rights to blacklist the mobile as the terms of agreement would have warned the original owner of this when they first signed up with VF. Also greatly depends on the type of ""blacklist"", if it's against VF only then there's theoretically no reason a 2degrees or Spark sim can't just be used instead. Problem being that if your parents are with VF then they'll need to port over to one of the others. What might be worth attempting though is going into a ""flag ship"" store near you which is one of the top tier stores and seeing if they have one of their VF Ninjas in store or a compassionate manager. You should be able to try and recruit them(aka, get their assistance lol) to contact head office/fraud team to see what your options are. It might take some time but if you can get the right staff member/store then you might actually get somewhere. Alternatively, the social media team are great(when you can eventually get a response) and really helpful but they will require the details of the person you bought it from and anything else that might be relevant. I wish you all the best as again, these are really shitty circumstances to be in and honestly why it pays to buy from Apple or an official seller or Apple products that way you can liaise directly with them if/when something goes pear shaped.

did they ever update their tests for the new strain?

edit:
workers gets gets tested, travellers get tested, all negative results. worker gets covid on our side of the border, so maybe they tested negative while positive (false negative). suppose someone just came through the gate with it and just gave it to them. how? did we stop testing travellers pre departure? if not that means a false negative overseas.

unless of course its something less obvious and more insidious. probably will just be another case of 'the tests dont work if given too early' or something, fine, i also consider that a false negative. at worst, its unknown pre existing community spread we dont know about yet - guess i could be wrong about this being test issues at the gate altogether.

now about the strains.

yes its a thing although risk is 'low' im just not sure if they have updated the tests to account for it.

Let’s put this in perspective. The last lockdown was August at level 3 in Auckland. This lockdown is currently 3 days (maybe more but we will see)

There is a new outfit in Taupo who are about to begin H2 production and by buying carbon credits and using thermal electric energy to create the H2 will call themselves ""Green"".
H2 is produced through electrolytic cells. It requires a monstrous amount of Electricity to run these cells and separate H2 from H2O. 

The energy wasted to produce the h2 could have just been used to charge electric cars in the first place. 
H2 is a great idea for energy storage especially in off peak times when excess power is created, H2 could be generated and stored only to be put back into the grid through generators when needed. 
But for mobile plant, it's very expensive and is not green. No mater what they tell you. 
It uses a Shit ton of power to create that H2.

These two gatehouses at a development on 80 Ruawai Rd, Mt Wellington have come in for considerable criticism by all the urban design ""experts"" that have columns to fill or axes to grind. 

These two sisters may on first glance be called plain - but ugly? Never. These two sisters have personality and charm. They both provide 3 bedrooms, 360 degree light into all internal spaces, good walkable connection to schools. public transport, shops, etc., and above all, they don't cost a fortune.

At present they stand out. This is to be expected as they're designed to the new Zoning implemented some years ago by Auckland Councils new focus on 'compact cities'. Consequently, people need to consider their neighbour will soon be equally tall. When Council grant consent they consider 'future built form' and how the new buildings will look surrounded by similar buildings. There is zero chance all buildings on this street will have equally 'plain' facades. And even if there are equally plain, they'll not be exactly the same and will form a pattern.

What I really love about these two sister gatehouses is the driveway between will form a point of interest, much like a mews. With good landscaping and planting pedestrians looking down the mews will wonder what's down there and who lives there. 

The section runs east-to-west so light will stream through mornings and evenings. I guess that's why the two sisters don't cantilever the two top floors over the driveway (or this could have been an engineering challenge that would have driven the price up).

Congratulations to the new owners and ignore the priggish nimbyism - may you enjoy your new warm, modern and extremely livable house for many years to come. (And if you're an investor? Shame on you - isn't one house enough for you?)",1613244695.0,2021-02-14 08:31:35,/r/auckland/comments/liqnxs/opinion_mt_wellington_townhouses_on_ruawai_road/gn9s7kb/,-1

Also on the topic of jumpers, I was suicidal for years, and frankly I wanted to jump off the bridge, I was just gonna climb over the barrier and slide down.

Just depends on where you are and what sort of distance you're wanting to do.  Being a city there is a limit on the length of most trails but you can chain them together.   Look on Google maps at the green bits, they pretty much all have tracks.  For elevation change just add a one or two of the many volcanos.

I've got a 20km run that's about 70-80% trail or park near me (northshore, rosedale), at Bushlands there's community built trails that won't show up on maps, let me know if you want to know the entrances as they're pretty hidden. 

 When I lived in St Heliers I used to run Mt Hobson, Mt St John, Mt Eden, One Tree Hill and Mt Wellington if I felt like it.

Further out of the city you can always catch a ferry to Rangitoto as well.  The Hunua's have lots of trails as do the Waitakere ranges (I think they're re-opened now).

I was coming from Mt Eden road heading towards Dominion road doing 40kph - 45kph in the left lane (2 lanes wide at this point). There was heavy traffic and the right lane was stopped completely (probably cause of the lights further up).

As i approached 1 of the side streets the right lane started moving, except for a small truck right before the intersection. As i found out very quickly the truck was leaving a gap for a car to turn into the side street, but between the wall of stopped traffic in the right lane and with how narrow the lanes are, neither me or the turning car could see each other until the turning cars bonnet was taking up part of my lane. 

Im quite surprised no one got rear ended and that i stopped before hitting the turning car. Genuinely thought it would be my first car accident in the moment.

Credit to the driver of the turning car too. They weren't pulling out fast, they were looking and they got out of the way quickly once id come to a stop. It was just a bad situation. I dont blame them at all for what happened, though legally i believe they would have been at fault if there was a crash.",1612940332.0,2021-02-10 19:58:52,/r/auckland/comments/lgk7gi/stay_safe_in_the_rain/gmsjp3m/,1

There are heaps of variations so its it's not just a every man for himself, shoot wildly with no objective that normal laser tag tends to be.

3025,Dental Implant + Crown Recommendations?,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_lfou1k,gmwvmc3,Japunese,"Hey bud, just a quick note. The surgical implant portion is usually around $2000-$3000 if placed by a specialist. You would then need to see your usual dentist to have it restored 2-3 months later. The restorative (crown) cost is usually around $2500-$3000 depending on the type of implant they use. It’s usually delayed rather than immediate loading to make the sure the implant integrates with the bone and is solid. You can get cheaper implants but these tend to be off-brand/less common implants.  While the implant heals your dentist will likely you offer the option of an overdenture (usually an additional cost) if it is a cosmetic concern. Functionally you should be fine without a tooth there unless you’re missing several teeth. 

Having implants placed overseas can be significantly cheaper however most dentists in NZ won’t restore these as different implant systems have different parts (wrenches etc). If you managed to get it restored overseas if you had problems with it down the road you’d be hard pressed to find a dentist here to work on it for you. 

Regardless of the dentist you go with you should be aware that you need to maintain implants regularly or they will fail. That means yearly checkups and regular hygiene maintenance.

You will have to message a few people because there’s a bit of competition but if you have accomodation in the mean time and some patience u should be able to find a nice suitable place.  It is a bit hectic at the moment with people coming into the city to start studying for the year.

I remember having that almost exact thought 10+ years ago - you’d see news of things like this and hear it was in South Auckland and think, yeah, west is pretty good.  Linda Cooper has been around the area for years, I’m pretty sure her feelings would mirror a lot of the people that have been in the area for a long time like me (us oldies lol).  She is active in Facebook groups and is good to go to with issues in the area.  She’s also pretty open about progress (or lack of it) when she has to deal with bureaucracy.  She seems to be a good one from what I’ve experienced.

I’ve lived out west for my whole life and in the Massey / West Harbour area for 20 years.  Yes, you definitely hear about things like this a lot more now (thanks social media and readily available news...) but when I was at school in the 80s - 90s, my walk to school route went passed a Head Hunters (house / headquarters whatever it’s called).  They would say hi occasionally if they were outside and I had no reason to be wary of them.  I would have police down my street 2-3 times a week because there was a drug house up the road...  but, if you didn’t live on my street, you didn’t hear about it - now it’s “breaking news” or whatever and the area Facebook groups are chatting about every little thing...  

I don’t worry too much about groups like the Head Hunters - they do their thing and I do mine and those things don’t cross over.  

I do worry about the other things like drug addicts breaking into my house cause they need stuff to sell to get a fix.  I do worry about newer gangs and non- gang related violence - they are unpredictable.  In saying that, I don’t know much about gangs and the links with the recent issues, so I may be barking up the wrong tree.",1612723625.0,2021-02-08 07:47:05,/r/auckland/comments/lel3th/gang_activity_in_west_auckland/gmhlo0d/,7

3316,Titirangi - Should I move there?,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_lcxjup,gm2tehx,iriminage,"**Advantages:** Titirangi village indeed is a bit of a gem (traffic allowing) but is mostly food shops (I think we counted 14 recently). TPS is a great school, as is Glen Eden Intermediate - can't speak for GBHS but I understand it has been coming up for quite a while. The Manukau beaches can be a bit skanky for water quality but are still nice scenery (see the French Bay Market) and access to Huia, KareKare, Whatipu, Piha etc is just magic. Exhibition Drive is a great way to get exercise away from cars (bike or walk). Kakamatua near Cornwallis is a great dog beach. The people generally tend to being creative/open/friendly. Criminal activity seems to have decreased over the past 10-20 years (e.g. being robbed because you live up a secluded driveway). Bike paths are starting to stretch out West into New Lynn and Henderson. Arts are well supported and represented. The long hot summers (thanks global warming) are bliss among the trees and the rise in work-from-home means your workplace can be your happy place. Woodlands Park (trees) and Glen Eden (generally no trees) are underrated, imo.

**Disadvantages:** driveways can be damn steep which can be both inconvenient and dangerous. Many houses are built in extreme shade because of slopes or trees which can become depressing due to lack of sunlight. We get 2m of rain a year against 1m in central AK so you have to put up with it and keep your gutters clear. Trees up against your house feels good until you get a massive puriri climbing over your roof for sun. Many houses have been cowboy built (e.g. leaky or on the road reserve) so you have to watch out when you buy. Scenic Drive is the worst, most dangerous, road in AK (imho) and you have to watch out for entitled locals in utes who want to do 90k, and bikes. Most of the local roads are not up to the traffic, though that's the norm for AK now. Being a half hour by bus (including walking there & waiting) from the nearest public transport hub (New Lynn) is a pain - it makes PT into the city a slog and my kids hate it. There are basically only 3 ways out to the city (Gt North Rd, Maioro street across the motorway and Hillsborough Road) so 75 minutes to work in central by car (against a 50 min bike ride)  is far too frequent. There are no damn jobs in West Auckland and they are getting further away. Many people who buy in Piha (when it was affordable) seem to last about one winter (similar to people who used to buy on Waiheke).",1612497840.0,2021-02-05 17:04:00,/r/auckland/comments/lcxjup/titirangi_should_i_move_there/gm2tehx/,28

1) Very hilly for kids. The option of riding up and down hills for fun vs a flat suburb means you really need to 'ride' the kids to get out and ride alongside as the paths are very narrow - until they are confident.   
2) Sections include bush - section size on paper and available use aren't the same.   
3) Good luck clearing our native bush - you need consents for felling trees unless they are invasive - bamboo is a real problem.   
4) Houses can be damp and have issues with mould. If the bush is so great the house is in the shade most hours of the day it gets way worse in winter.

Going home is worse, and can be a nightmare in rush hour (4:30-6:30). Northwestern motorway can be a car park. I use a motorbike though, and its 30mins max - regardless of traffic. The train from New Lynn is ok - but like all our trains is pretty slow. Bus service is ok, but takes hours. 25-30mins to the airport outside rushhour.

Titirangi is pretty good for your needs, and has some good places to eat and socialise. Good shops/hardware stores etc nearby in New Lynn when you need it.

As others have mentioned some houses must be horrible, damp and cold. Others (like mine) is full sun from sunrise to sunset, private, and surrounded by bush.

The bush looks nice, but is often riddled with weeds (ginger and jasmine mainly). Don't underestimate the effort required to keep your section under control, it grows faaaaast.

There is almost nowhere flat to run/ride/walk the kids - Exhibition drive is the best, and is stunning though. Awesome trails and places to run, Arataki is beautiful too. If you have a dog - Kakamatua is great, and Cornwallis too (outside summer hours).

The beaches are very tidal, but are beautiful when the water is in. Fishing can be pretty good in the harbour if thats your thing, and its a scenic and therapeutic place for a morning kayak.

I did live in Titirangi a couple of months as an adult, a long time back, I don't remember the commute but can't imagine it's good now. I see the on-ramp at Pt Chev regularly now and that's nasty and probably a minimum 20 minute drive to there from downtown Titirangi.  
There are plenty of worse places to live, though.",1612515231.0,2021-02-05 21:53:51,/r/auckland/comments/lcxjup/titirangi_should_i_move_there/gm3hwmx/,2
3326,Anyone brought a turn key with Jalcon homes?,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_ld3kz8,gm73amy,TazDingoYes,"I recommend checking through the masses of comments on http://www.builderreviews.co.nz/ just do ctrl+f and type in Jalcon. That's how I did my research on other companies, and it was way more enlightening than customer testimonials. Just be super cautious, the general consensus is that franchise builders can be extremely dodgy, and even a franchise in Auckland might differ from the same company's franchise in Wellington or wherever.

Things you need to look out for are not just Master Builder guarantees (which are kinda BS but better to have than not), but also developer guarantees and processes on getting defects sorted. They should also be able to tell you who they contract out to primarily. You also should ask about budget blowouts and where/how costs are passed on if they can't source something they promised (let's say you ask for minimum spec kitchen fittings, they can't source it, put in more expensive taps without permission - do they charge you, or eat the cost for not doing their homework?)

Turnkey is better than progressive payment but house and land packages are stressful as fuck if you don't do your homework thoroughly on builders, and the thing is that a mortgage broker probably won't have much info on whether a company sucks, unless they've dealt with them personally. 

Also I'd be wary on short turnaround times, because most of these companies have utterly shit contracts that take around 2 weeks of back and forth to get through. You probably will have to make amendments to keep your money safe, because generally speaking, the contracts are written with the assumption the customer is clueless and won't ask about things like whether the deposit goes into a trust (which is a requirement by Kainga Ora), or whether the developer can sell your house from under you once it's built.

Just make sure to take your time, because there are a lot of hurdles. Not even including crap the bank will ask you to pay for before letting you have a mortgage.",1612583000.0,2021-02-06 16:43:20,/r/auckland/comments/ld3kz8/anyone_brought_a_turn_key_with_jalcon_homes/gm73amy/,5
3327,Anyone brought a turn key with Jalcon homes?,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_ld3kz8,gm9dg83,redmostofit,"Hey. My partner and I bought a new Jalcon apartment (mid-build) a year and a half ago. It's been a pretty good experience so far, and the company has been great to deal with.

We found the timeline of purchasing a little odd, as there were lots of deadlines for signing things or making payments that were technically deal breakers (we could have lost the purchase, kind of thing) but they were quite lax about it all. We would just ask for extensions pending finance/paperwork and they were happy to extend each time. I think once they know you're committed to buying they are quite reasonable (that could just have been our experience though).

Follow ups for minor building issues got dealt with quickly (they did a free 6 month and 1 year check and fixed anything that might be a problem, including paint marks, replaced a cabinet that has a scratch).

We're looking at their new developments too for a larger home and would happily buy from Jalcon again.

Where abouts are you looking at buying? We're in Hobsonville where they have a really good reputation. Finishings and design seem to be preferred over some of the other companies.",1612639188.0,2021-02-07 08:19:48,/r/auckland/comments/ld3kz8/anyone_brought_a_turn_key_with_jalcon_homes/gm9dg83/,1

My claim under review,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_ld0zv4,gm38t00,briskestthunderclap,"Insurance companies often deny claims if the driver wasn't following licence conditions, and they think they can make a case that not following them increased the risk.

Restricted licence conditions allow other passengers in the car if there is a supervisor who has a full NZ licence and has had it for 2 years in the front seat (the same as for driving at night). They also allow 'the holder’s spouse, partner, parent, guardian, or dependant' as a passenger.

There is also [s11 of the Insurance Law Reform Act 1977](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1977/0014/latest/DLM442558.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_insurance_resel_25_a&p=1), which says that even if an insurance contract says an insurer is not liable in certain circumstances (e.g. not following licence conditions), if the person insured can prove on the balance of probability that the loss was not contributed to by those circumstances, then the insurer is still liable. So for example, if a driver had a crash while having passengers in the car in breach of a licence condition, and the contract said insurance doesn't apply if the licence conditions are breached, and the driver could prove that it is more likely than not that the passengers weren't a contributing factor to the crash, the insurance company would still be liable to pay out. If an insurance company denied a claim and the insured party sued them, they would have to convince the adjudicator of that fact. The insurance company might argue in defence that, for example, the passengers would have been a distraction, and so were a contributing factor to an accident that could have been avoided if the driver was less distracted.",1612507560.0,2021-02-05 19:46:00,/r/auckland/comments/ld0zv4/would_insurance_pass_my_claim_if_i_drove_with_my/gm38t00/,13

I don't think a tipping culture drives better service either. Service in NZ feels so much more genuine and respectful in both directions than overseas. Staff don't have to fear losing a tip for speaking authentically, and if they're nice I can assume its because they want to be (and its their job) rather than gassing me up for a bigger tip. In the US once you've handed over your tip the service changes dramatically (and I usually tip 20% which isn't stingy).

Tipping culture has some pretty questionable origins in the US, going back to when minimum wages were introduced at the end of slavery.

I would suggest following up with the Council to check on progress, but be prepared to not necessarily get the answer you are after within the timeframe you are after. 

As far as action goes against the Council, in New Zealand parties are generally unable to sue for personal injury where claims are covered by ACC, but if you are considering a negligence action against the Council that may be a different story.

As others have said, contact a lawyer. Most will be able to advise on merits of a claim once you have given them the relevant info and that initial consultation tends to be free.

As a previous reply mentioned, we can't sue for injuries in NZ due to ACC.  However,  the sentencing amendment act 2014 made provision that the courts can order compensation for losses not covered by ACC.  This only kicks in when a liable party is found guilty in a court of a criminal offence. (Eg a driver found guilty of dangerous driving).  
I can't recall the name,  but there is a lawyer in auckland that champions this for victims. 
In saying all of that,  it's not easy,  in my personal experience it was a police prosecuted case and the police prosecutor wasn't even aware of the amendment. The judge will have to make an order in the sentencing for compensation,  so ensure your representation pushes!

$500k is enough for her to buy her own property, and in the future she would be able to use the equity from that property to help both your fiance and his brother onto the housing market.

I totally empathise with what your MIL is going through - divorce, depression and lonliness. That can't be easy.

 I think before you consider going further with properties your MIL's mental health needs to be addressed. Therapy will give her a good outlet and CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) would be a good place to start. Instead of saying ""hell to the no"" to your partner, get him on board with supporting your MIL with her recovery. 

WRT her living situation, if she discusses this with a therapist (someone that isn't biased) she will develop skills to make her realise that she can't expect you to put aside your comfort for her personal needs. Additionally, she may come to the realisation that she can't afford to live in a house with her lifestyle she was previously used to. with CBT she will also develop skills to cope with loneliness or being alone. She sounds like she needs that opportunity to grow.

Suggesting therapy or getting help is going to show that you are more supportive of MIL's well being rather than turning her down and potentially causing beef.

You could also voice it as ""Your mother is in a difficult place right now and I don't want her to make any big financial decisions just yet.

Transfer is more-or-less a 2v2 real-time-strategy game, quite a bit different to actual chess, and each game is usually over quite quickly due to the 1-minute hourglass mode timer on each clock. Victory conditions are: capture one of the opponents' kings, or, time out one of the opponents. If you capture a piece you hand it to your teammate, who can at any time during their turn place the piece anywhere on their board in lieu of moving a piece. Pawns do not promote, and cannot be dropped on the first rank.

It used to be played only one lunchtime a week at a particular high school because supposedly it affects your practice in playing actual chess.",1611985008.0,2021-01-30 18:36:48,/r/auckland/comments/l7h6ux/any_chess_clubs_in_auckland/glc8yu6/,1

4043,UoA Epsom Campus,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_l6qgqd,gl6c5n4,Throwjob42,"I hated it. I did a G Dip Tching (Secondary) so I was technically there for a year but was off on practicum for 12 weeks. Reasons why I hated Epsom:

1. It was harder for me to make friends because even though my programme was large, I only had about four or five people I consistently knew because we were divided into other subjects. The cohort was also more diverse in terms of age range, there were people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s doing things which meant we were more guarded about how we communicated to each other. We also just didn't spend much classroom time together because we were off on practicum. People in different programmes tend not to mix with each other, in my experience.

2. The staff are weirdly lawless. There is no real oversight from UoA management because Epsom Campus used to be Auckland Teacher's College until it was absorbed by UoA and it's very difficult to hold teaching personnel accountable to anyone (I dodged these issues but some of my friends ended up just getting screwed by lecturers who would demand last-minute changes to assignment specifications). There's also fewer choices for classes, I specialized in two subjects which meant I was forced to see the two lecturers who taught those classes (both of whom I despised). A lot of the lecturers (not all) were quite out of touch with how teaching high school actually worked. One of my lecturers gave very strict rules about how to be a good teacher, and when I was on practicum I asked active teachers if they did any of those things (they did not). One mentor teacher I had on practicum summed it up best, 'those who can't teach, teach the teachers so they're not around vulnerable schoolchildren'.

3. The facilities are very run-down. UoA has been promising to shut down Epsom Campus every year since 2015 and absorb the Faculty of Education to City Campus, so they don't seem interested in investing money on bettering the buildings. The air con in a lot of the buildings sucked so hot months were unbearable, and cold months were freezing. There's also no student bar (at least when I went there) and as someone who loved hanging at Shadows, that was a real disappointment. There was a lawn bowls club next door which did serve alcohol and I seriously debated getting my friends to sign up for membership so we had a place to hang out.

4. The vibe is way different because of the suburb. Being in the CBD gives a real melting-pot feel to City Campus which I really benefited from. Epsom has a much more middle-class feel which I always found a bit off-putting.

5. Public transport to Epsom can just suck. All Auckland PT seems to care about is getting you to the CBD. Parking is free IIRC.

6. Clubs are way less a thing, for reasons I guess included in reason 1. I loved joining student clubs in City Campus.

7. It's very job-oriented, which sounds obvious, but it's a lot less fun than City Campus because the faculty are constantly trying to push you to sell yourself (which if you're doing a teaching diploma, you should do, but it got uncomfortable after a while).

That's my rant, and I'm only one person who went there so I am not saying my experience is everyone's experience.",1611883653.0,2021-01-29 14:27:33,/r/auckland/comments/l6qgqd/uoa_epsom_campus/gl6c5n4/,3

Music is amazing - and surprising. Sometimes the tiniest crowd is the most amazing performer. Try everything! 

Bring a chair definitely. The main tent has chairs but you’ll need one for the others - or just bring a blanket and sit on the ground. Whatever you’re comfortable with. Oh yeah all the venues bar one are tents on the ground. 

Bring some food and drinks - it’s byo (incredible right!) with no alcohol sales onsite. Plus if you have a Sunday ticket you can camp for free that night. There are food options on site. They are plentiful for what you’ll need for a day but if staying longer there’s a supermarket up the road. 

It’s my favorite small festival with the best chill vibe. You’ll discover something new and can take part as much or as little as you like. It is its own community for the weekend - safe, friendly and supportive. 

If you play an instrument there are also various jams all day long and into the night. 

One warning is that it gets hot! So make sure to bring a hat and sunnies and have sunscreen on. I recommend extra supplies kept in your car as well: a shirt and deodorant if you stay all day as well as a jumper for the evening.

4161,Canoe and Kayak enthusiasts - where do you go?,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_l54v37,gksmrx6,redmostofit,"Around Auckland? Kayaking up the Kotukutuku Inlet (basically from Herald Island to Riverhead) is quite fun. The Riverhead Tavern has a docking area where you can tie up your kayak, walk up the stairs and enjoy the pub. You would generally be leaving from Christmas Beach on Herald Island, though you could go from Hobsonville Point as well (just a bit longer).  


A really nice evening kayak to do is from Okahu Bay to Devonport. The water is often really calm at dusk. Again, get to the other side and you can grab fish and chips or go to a pub then kayak back. Just make sure your kayak has a light and flag, and watch out for the Waiheke ferry.  


Kayaking to Rangitoto is great. You can pull your boat up at some of the bach boat ramps (to the left of the ferry terminal). We've just left our kayaks in the bushes next to the baches while we walked up the mountain. They're fine unattended (you've got to be pretty committed to steal a kayak on an island). You can do that one from Takapuna or Mission Bay (recommended).

St Helier's to Browns Island is good, but the weather needs to be favourable. Can get pretty choppy in that area. Nothing to do on the island, but you can take a picnic.  


You can kayak to Waiheke, but it takes ages.. I would recommend ferrying over and renting a kayak there. You can kayak to Rotoroa Island from Waiheke.  


If you go north and leave from Waiwera you can kayak to Moturekareka or Motuora Island. Moturekareka has a shipwreck you can explore.",1611638741.0,2021-01-26 18:25:41,/r/auckland/comments/l54v37/canoe_and_kayak_enthusiasts_where_do_you_go/gksmrx6/,9

Also paddled up the Whau recently, to be honest it wasn't anywhere near as nice, the river is too wide, and it's not very scenic (mostly mangroves). The New Lynn end of the river is just paddling along the back of a bunch of factories, and there's a lot of rubbish. (Also the only place to stop for lunch is a boat ramp in a park in Kelston).

I used to be an idiot and did stupid things with my performance cars around that same time frame. 

I don't know if it's just me getting older (30 now, switched the skyline for a navara) and losing touch, or if it's actually the same now as it was back then, but it feels like laurels/ceferos/silvias/skylines/supras/rx7s/integras used to be everywhere and now if I see one it's a rare occasion.

It's probably to be expected; the cheap, easily modified cars from the 90's-00's are getting older and more and more are removed from the roads every year. Also, kids these days likely didn't grow up with Gran Turismo, Initial D, and The Fast and the Furious.

I'd imagine the same scene still exists in similar numbers but ""boy racers"" are using relatively more modern cars.

The bad:
- anything on Hobson and Nelson streets. Even if there are some decent buildings, there is just too much traffic there
-the poky little student apartments along Anzac Ave, Symonds St, Mount St (unless you don’t mind small spaces). 

The good: 
- eden crescent area has some really nice older apartment buildings. Some of them are quite spacious and it’s a nice part of the CBD
- the metropolis on high st
- Albert St. A bit of construction at the moment, but if you are thinking long term this is a perfect spot in the middle of the city. Occasionally apartments for rent come up in the Stamford Residences. Barclay is also good on Albert St. 

Seeing as you are looking to rent, you should also consider some of the waterfront apartments (wouldn’t recommend buying because they are leasehold).

Agree with the advice above re being designed for long term living. Looking to see if washer/dryer included also a good sign of whether the designers were thinking about building a practical place to live rather than shoeboxes.

AT has a network map and thicker coloured lines represent services which run at least 15 minutes or better during the day. The train network is still hobbled by the fact that it only runs every 20 minutes during the day and so it's often the bus connections which matter more.

4347,Laid back wedding ideas (help),auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_l4ffhj,gkohnt2,trinsky,"TBH the cost for a 150 person wedding isn't necessarily the venue, it's the food & alcohol (and if you want flowers & music... woosh).

Council owned parks and reserves will charge a 300 fee, or you can look into hiring out a campsite (good, coz you have accomodation & on-site kitchens for the caterers.) Food trucks sound like they'll be good, but you may find that hiring caters + a generator truck is actually cheaper, and gives you more options. For a bar, you can get away with a bathtub full of ice, though you will a duty manager onsite. If you want to decorate an otherwise... average looking space, you would also pay a lot for styling services.

Honestly, what you save in money for DIY'ing a wedding of this size, you pay for in time.

If you want a time/money economic option, an off-season wedding (usually 20% cheaper) at a local wedding venue where you also buy into their food/booze package could be a good (if a little cookie-cutter) option. They already have everything there, you pretty much just show up on the day.

It's the opposite of being a bridezilla. A bridezilla cant handle other people having responsibility because they will do it their way and she wants everything just so.

My in laws made ALL the desserts. They did an amazing job. They did the set up, dishes, everything. I didn't even know what they were making until I arrived. So nice not to worry about it. 

You can delegate manning the drinks stand and organising it. Put all the teenagers on serving finger foods. Basically look at the strengths and talents of your families and recruit away.

Sales engineer in automation dealing with OEMs and

Good pay if you can actually sell stuff
Flexible work hours if you can actually sell stuff
Low stress while the project isn't late.
Overall pretty good job


Software engineer in web/app development
Good pay
Flexible work hours. But in order to meet some deadlines significant overtime is required on occasion.
Low stress. The facilities are great stocked fridge, pool table etc. High ish stress when sites and apps are being launched. 
Overall again pretty good.


Both of us have traveled to multiple countries if that's interesting to you.

**OPINION:**

Paula Bennett for Auckland mayor? Bet that focuses the mind, on both sides of the political divide.

Or Sir John Kirwan? Never won a championship as a coach, but he's everyone's winner really, isn't he? And hey, maybe when Grant Dalton gets sick of messing about in boats he'd like a proper challenge? 

Maybe not. Besides, if we need a sports  star, why go past Dame Valerie Adams? A community champion, tougher  than her brother, Steven, and far more friendly.

It's  time to find the next mayor of Auckland. The election is not till next  year, but the contenders will be in place by the end of this year, which  means the search starts now.

The incumbent,  Phil Goff, has implied, without quite saying it directly, that he won't  be standing again. He'll be 69, which is younger than new US president  Joe Biden, although that's not exactly saying a lot.

&#x200B;

 

What's the job? It's not a retirement sinecure. We need a mayor who grasps the potential of this city.

Auckland  could become – here's a quick list – an innovative, prosperous,  low-carbon, inclusive, people-friendly, climate-adapted, culturally  rich, design-led and much funner centre than anywhere else on the  planet. The very model of how a city can flourish in the 21st century.

We're not really on track for all that, but is it too much to ask? If we could be that city, shouldn't we try?

&#x200B;

 We need an activist mayor. And it is surely not too much to hope for  someone who is not a Pākehā man in late middle age. What a shame that  rules out Chris Liddell. 

&#x200B;

 

The model is Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, which has a population of 2.1 million: it's not much bigger than Auckland.

Under  Hidalgo, planning rules focus on climate action and a liveable city.  Social housing has been expanded, new buildings must be carbon positive  and the tram, metro and cycling networks have been vastly improved.

Famously,  Hidalgo has pedestrianised the quays that run beside the River Seine.  She's faced relentless opposition but she has not wavered. Paris has a  mayor with vision, courage for the battle and skills persuasive enough  to win it. Who have we got?

First up, there's  Goff himself. He could stay on and be the new mayor we need. All he'd  need to do is abandon his natural instinct to smoothly manage the status  quo and become instead a champion of innovation and change. It's not  impossible.

&#x200B;

 

Goff is the second mayor of Auckland the supercity.  Both he and his predecessor, Len Brown, were supported by the Labour  Party machine and won two elections each, always with big margins.

From that, it's tempting to think the Auckland mayoralty is Labour's to decide. But it's not so simple.

Labour usually wins the west and south; National the east and north. The central isthmus can go either way.

It's  not that the centre-right is excluded. Rather, it's unlikely an  old-style right-wing campaign against rates rises will have much appeal  beyond the entrenched voters of the wealthy suburbs. Despite the noise  those voters make.

But a popular centre-right  candidate with good ideas for transport, housing, race relations and  climate action should be able to win. Nikki Kaye, anyone?

She  might have been a shoo-in, until she became Todd Muller's deputy in the  National Party and her leadership skills collapsed. She blew it. So  maybe not Nikki Kaye.

&#x200B;

 

It also seems unlikely those other casualties from  2020, National's Paul Goldsmith and Labour's Phil Twyford, will seek a  new career on the ratepayer tab.

But Paula  Bennett's still in the hunt. She's capable and a genuinely popular  Westie, which gives her crossover appeal. But does she have any kind of  vision for Auckland?

Cities are where it's at.  Councils don't control taxpayers' money but the things they can get done  often make a real difference to people's lives.

The  Bloomberg Cities Network, a foundation set up by former New York mayor  Michael Bloomberg, has just launched the ""Mayors Challenge"". They're  looking for ""50 leading urban innovations that were imagined or launched  in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic"" and that ""have the potential for  meaningful impact and the ability to spread to other cities"".

We need a mayor filled with the spirit of that kind of thinking and with the desire to act it out.

None  of the current councillors has the profile and the skills. Flamboyant  National Party doyenne Desley Simpson, the finance committee chairwoman,  is popular in only the eastern suburbs. Planning committee chairman  Chris Darby, an independent, has a fine grasp of the big challenges  facing council but he keeps telling the other councillors off and they  don't like it. Nor would voters.

&#x200B;

 

Manukau's Fa'ananu Efeso Collins, in contrast, is a  gifted orator, a Labour member, and could have become a serious  candidate for the top job. But speaking well seems to be his only  leadership skill: his colleagues question his commitment, work rate and  lack of teamwork. You can't be a leader if no one will follow.

If  Goff does have an heir apparent on council it's Richard Hills, chairman  of the climate change and environment committee. He's in his early 30s,  hard-working and well liked: a rising talent in the Labour Party. But  if he wants the top job one day he'll need to build a much higher  profile, be more dynamic and, frankly, a little less beholden to the  boss.

&#x200B;

 

The drums always beat for business leaders, but  their big problem in politics is that they can't choose their own team  and just tell everyone what to do. So they can end up lost: ask Tenby  Powell in Tauranga.

Auckland councillors don't  caucus and even those in the same party often don't agree. The mayor  basically has learn how to work with whichever 20 randoms get elected to  council.

The business leader with a terrific  in-depth sense of both the economic and cultural lifebloods of Auckland  is Chapman Tripp chief executive Nick Wells. But he doesn't have a high  profile and he's probably quite happy where he is.

&#x200B;

 

Viv Beck, chief executive of the business group  Heart of the City, used to be widely regarded, but she burned her  bridges last year by pushing, in effect, for a halt to urban development  on Queen St.

Where the hell are all the mayoral candidates?

The  biggest problem is that the job looks awful. People complain all the  time, much of the work is trivial, Wellington has most of the power and  the councillors and officials are not always good enough.

But the job is actually splendid. You're mayor of this great shining city by the sea!

Maybe  we should choose an entertainer. How about the newly knighted Dave  Dobbyn, whose songs make manifest the soul of the nation? Or Hilary  Barry: she could get all frocked up, with the tiara if she wants, and  she's actually brilliant at telling people what to do.

&#x200B;

 

Or, wait for it, what about our most experienced politician, that admirably outspoken advocate for progress Helen Clark!

I  know, she has bad thoughts about Eden Park concerts. But in all other  respects what's not to like? She'd take a red hot poker to all those  council ditherers and in 2022 she'll still be only 72.

Helen Clark vs Paula Bennett. One for the ages, so to speak. Although, tbh, better ideas are welcome.",1611270586.0,2021-01-22 12:09:46,/r/auckland/comments/l2a8ms/simon_wilson_could_paula_bennett_become_the_next/gk46ekp/,22

Light Rail will go the way of KiwiBuild, I suspect.

I think they probably have good intentions, but very little in the way of real-world experience, so although they can describe what they want to do, they are unable to conceive of a workable plan to actually bring their ideas to fruition, because they fundamentally don't understand impacts or cause and effect.

Take the Housing Crisis, for example.

Everyone is concerned about the constantly rising price of houses. They just (re)announced that they will build 8000 state houses. To achieve this, they will need trained builders/plumbers/electricians.

There is a limited pool of trained builders/plumbers/electricians in NZ. 

If they manage to attract a large number of trained builders/plumbers/electricians to work on these state houses, there will be fewer trained builders/plumbers/electricians to work in the private sector. 

If there are fewer builders/plumbers/electricians working in the private sector, there will be more competition for their services, which will enable the private sector builders/plumbers/electricians to increase their rates, which will in turn continue to exert upward pressure on house prices. Not to mention that, with fewer private sector builders/plumbers/electricians, fewer private sector houses will be built, also pushing up prices.

Supply and demand. It's not rocket surgery!",1611370249.0,2021-01-23 15:50:49,/r/auckland/comments/l2h2p6/whats_happening_with_light_rail/gka8pkx/,2

At Greville onramp, a car merged from the onramp straight into the right lane.  We collided.  I didn't fall, but I smushed two fingers hard against his non-folding mirror, and had bruises along my left side.

The bike was damaged.  The shift lever was curled into a pretzel.

We pulled onto the hard shoulder for him to yell at me, matching the speed of the car in front and behind me at 30k obviously speeding and driving unsafely.  Somewhere in there, we exchanged information, and I realized that, despite blood dripping out of my glove, I could work the clutch with my remaining fingers, and the munted shift lever worked if I took my foot off the peg and kicked it hard.

While on the shoulder doing the legal minimum to clear the scene, a bus rode up to 2 meters back, and laid on his horn.

There was visibility to us, both with hazards on for hundreds of meters.  But the bus found it necessary to get so close it had trouble pulling around, and honking at people properly using the breakdown lane.

I rode straight to the A&E and got my fingers xrayed and bandaged (no break, but some physical therapy), then to the shop to get the shift lever straightened best they could (still like that, good as new, just a cosmetic dogleg), then off to work, to sit at a desk and stare at a screen for 4 hours before my brain turned back on.",1611190897.0,2021-01-21 14:01:37,/r/auckland/comments/l1hpzt/a_message_for_auckland_drivers/gk0dm46/,7

At 8.30am we were definitely running late and stuck in traffic, coming up to the Wellesley/Port off ramp (coming from the North Western motorway). The guy in front of us starts rear ending people, speeding up, slowing down, and just generally driving dangerously. We thought he was on drugs but we knew something was wrong and so decided to pull over as his car drifted towards the left hand barrier, and try block the road so he'd be safe.

Boy, were people upset about that. Dirty looks, swearing, people generally getting shitty at me blocking one lane of the road. They were awful and no one stopped to help us except for one guy on a motorbike. Turns out the guy in the car we were trying to help was having a diabetic seizure. His doors were the type to automatically lock so we had to just watch the poor guy, still only in his twenties, have a seizure in front of us. All we could do was try and make sure he wasn't in any external danger, and people were just awful to us while we tried to do so.

Eventually a police officer arrived on scene to help direct traffic, but before she arrived the drivers going each way seemed to handle the wordless communication required to allow some traffic to go through one way and then some traffic to come through the other way.  When people spoke to me at all, it was only to offer help or condolences every single time.

A few years ago, I witnessed somebody drive directly into the back of another car waiting to turn at an intersection.  Both drivers doors opened and I wondered what I was about to witness.  In the red corner, a specialist in rear attacks, we had a late 20s/early 30s pacific islands woman, in the blue corner we had an old white dude.  Red was absolutely beside herself, breaking down into tears before any fight could even get started.  Blue gave her a big hug.

I just wanted to add a couple anecdotes of my own to the discussion.

**25/01/2020:**

* Added in authentication(only google login works now, facebook login and other still in development) for user validations to prevent unwanted spams also for database secrutiy reasons, only logged in user now allows like, rating and reporting of crimes.
* Added in user profile(core functionalities still in development)
* Added in suburb safety analysing, including overall safety score comparing to other suburbs and chances of a certain crime might happen in the area, *do note that only few suburbs has the new safety section as I continue to update the other present surburbs, to try it out Grey Lynn is good to go*

4706,Auckland Transport is bringing plans to completely electrify its bus network forward by a whole decade — in a funding challenge to the council.,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_l0yajq,gjwausk,dingoonline,"> The Council had previously committed its transport organisation to stop funding new diesel buses from 2025, and to phase out all the existing ones by 2040 – but its subsidiary has now brought that forward to 2030 – subject to Council funding.
> 
> But Auckland's commitment still trails Wellington: the country's small capital has 10 electric buses on the road and has already ordered 98 more, as it seeks to replace its trolley bus network with carbon-free alternatives. Tauranga and Christchurch have both rolled out small fleets of electric buses. 
> 
> Last night, Phil Goff told Newsroom the council intended to budget to replace the diesels that make up most of the city's 1352-bus fleet; already, the Government has pledged funding. He said Auckland Transport would not fund any new diesel buses from July (though it is understood the transport organisation is telling bus operators to stop buying diesel vehicles right now).

This on its own will do very little for meeting the [council's carbon targets](https://transport2030.org/). It's also going to be a significant cost-issue for a lot of bus suppliers as most of AT's fleet is incredibly new (also quite fuel-efficient), resulting from the new frequent network and new contract negotiations that came out of PTOM. 

For that reason, electrification has come at a much more convenient time for Wellington, who are currently using a lot of our old buses which are at end-of-life. Hopefully the current buses will be shipped off to a third-world country or elsewhere that'll take them for use [like our old diesel trains](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/96160309/from-morningside-to-mozambique-aucklands-diesel-trains-shipped-to-africa) — which will help with cost recovery and sustainability.

What I'm more interested in is the quality-of-life improvements that'll come. Electric buses can roll much smoother, accelerate faster, and are of course are much quieter. For example, I've always been able to work on double-decker buses and our electric trains, but never on a normal diesel bus as its always been too noisy/loud/rattley. That should hopefully help encourage some modeshift.",1611106189.0,2021-01-20 14:29:49,/r/auckland/comments/l0yajq/auckland_transport_is_bringing_plans_to/gjwausk/,29

Always going to be exceptions at both ends though.

I highly recommend looking up the building you're interested in on google maps. There's some terrible tenants and building managers around. Like the other guy said, avoid Volt, Zest, and I'd also avoid anything on upper Hobson street like City Garden etc. There's a building up there with over 50% housing NZ tenancy.

Victoria residences is nice. As is the overall Sugartree complex.

Also important to note that the rental market up here is incredibly competitive. You'll need to apply for a couple, and really drive home good references and financial stability.

Internet should be no more than $80/month for unlimited fibre unless you want gigabit. 

Car parks in apartment buildings are around $80/wk at the moment. If you're not living in the city I'd advise looking for transit - parking near AUT is limited and busy.

Water is often included in rent in apartments, it is for me so I don't know those costs. Remember that your landlord can only charge the consumption rate, the fixed connection costs can’t be charged to you. 

Power again depends. Some apartments have central hot water so that’s in the rent, you’d be looking at $100-$200 per month depending on hot water and your own appliance usage. If you're using electric heating in winter that'll add another $100-$200/month depending on how much you use. The modern apartment buildings in the city don't need much heating, but houses do because of NZ Quality Housing.

I'd also advise contents insurance, that's around $40-50/month for $250 excess and $50k+ cover.",1611021600.0,2021-01-19 15:00:00,/r/auckland/comments/l08dql/average_living_cost_to_pay_when_live_in_city/gjs91w0/,8

4943,Where should I go for great NZ men’s fashion?,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_kzyz0w,gjrpuc9,240p,"If you're wanting NZ made for ethical or environmental reasons then definitely avoid Rodd & Gunn and Merchant 1948, as both exploit cheap offshore goods and labour. Regarding Merchant 1948 specifically, from experience their goods are low-quality, poorly-made trash. Avoid them like the plague. Rodd & Gunn don't seem much better but someone else might correct me. Basically, don't touch a mall.

Finding actual Made in NZ clothing is really pretty difficult. Some NZ designers are doing the whole 'ethical supply chain' thing, like AS Colour and Kowtow, but these still leverage cheap offshore labour. Tearfund (which I don't know much about as an organisation) [put out a report](https://www.tearfund.org.nz/Get-Involved/Ethical-Fashion-Guide.aspx?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6ri01oXP4wIVz4BwCh1UwQhkEAAYASAAEgIr-fD_BwE) for ethical fashion last year, which you might find interesting. Merchant and Rodd & Gunn both scored pretty poorly. Overall it seems like our industry is doing 'fine', which, to be honest, isn't really good enough.

One way of avoiding these issues is to buy second hand, and Auckland has plenty of stores. The CBD has a few 'designer' second-hand clothing stores. Onehunga has, as far as I know, at least 5-6 great stores for clothing. Salvation Army are pretty well-known as being rabid homophobes, so maybe avoid them. Savemart (who are kind of scummy to their workers, but the clothing is at least second-hand) has locations all across the country, with at least 6 in Auckland. Other local charity and hospice shops are dotted around the place too.  Maybe I'll put together a 'best op-shops of Auckland' list and get peoples suggestions.

We visited a house recently and it was overkill with the diffusers and the price was too good to be true. Opened up the bedroom closet and there was mould all up the wall. Our current house had the same issue but they had recently painted which I think may have been an attempt to mask the issue. The smell was so bad (wet dog/bleach) when we first moved in and not long into our tenancy our daughters toy wicker bin was covered in white fluff (mould). I think, unfortunately it's quite common in Auckland homes from what I have read and heard from other renters. We look out for a DVS system or an HRV system now just incase, because often houses are rented out in the warmer months and it's harder to tell. I'm rambling on now but our first rental had a mould issue that was so bad that when a healthy home inspector popped in to check our place out he told us to GTFO and that he smelt it (mould) as soon as we opened the door. Eventually the mould ate up the carpet in our bedroom and destroyed our bed. The agent (quinovic) wouldn't let us end the tenancy because ""I'll never be able to rent this out in winter"". The actual owners were lovely and offered us a hotel room until it got sorted. We didn't take up the offer but we ended up in the living room until they replaced the carpet and repainted. They installed a DVS that honestly helped so much. They kept our rent low until we left a few years later.

It depends entirely on the spec you're looking at.

10k budget gets you very basic/minimal no frills stuff to be frank.

As far as the wall goes, it depends on if it's load bearing or not. If it's not, then you're looking at demo costs, cabinetry, benchtops, flooring and patching+painting walls. And that's without even considering electrical/plumbing - for instance, that dishwasher may require at very least a new plumbing run and a splice of existing electrical.

That'll probably only get you at very most a laminate benchtop, the cheapest cabinetry you can get, sheet vinyl floor, patch and paint and you *may* have enough leftover to get that dishwasher. Assuming the wall isn't load bearing, because if it is then you'll likely require an LVL beam. Which would probably mean having to skip the dishwasher.

Kitchens and bathrooms are typically by far the most expensive sqm area of a house. To be frank with you, as you've probably started to understand from my post, a 10k budget means you're getting minimum / entry level stuff. Even if you were to have a crack at DIYing some of this, I'd assume you have bare minimal tools so that's an added expense which soaks up a lot of the ""profitability"" of DIYing, as well as costing you severely in man hours.

tl;dr if you're wanting *some* nice stuff, you're probably looking at doubling your budget, if not more.

Fwiw, I'm no remodel specialist. I'm in trades, but some of the other trades pricings are beyond my working knowledge, I'm working on a rough guesstimate of what I do know, which admittedly for some of the other trades isn't a hell of a lot.",1610951321.0,2021-01-18 19:28:41,/r/auckland/comments/kysbfv/what_did_your_auckland_kitchen_renovation_cost/gjp372v/,1

I might be wrong, so correct me if I am. The doors were open last evening and this am when I went by...

The area up by the Jewish cemetery, that park with the bronze sculpture.. I wouldn't enter that park for love nor money at the moment.
In the middle of the day I've seen punch ups, people pissing against the sculpture, standover bs going down, people passed put. 
I saw a woman shooting up on the bench there yesterday as I was stopped at the lights. 

Meyers Park: I am a pretty decent sized guy who knows how to carry himself and maybe that's why I've had no trouble but no way will I risk it at the moment. The stairs down by the Basement Theatre are a hang out for all kinds of people at the moment, I've seen drug deals going down and a pack of asshole teenage kids harranging homeless people AND homeless folk barking all kinds of shit at passersby.

Then you have stores creasing the code or sticking the codes to the window with double sided tape rendering the code unscannable..

This can be fixed if the stores laminated their codes.. but obviously the govt isn't forcing them to.

The QR code itself is so difficult to scan, I need to fill the entire rectangle for it to scan. It doesn't let me zoom and as I result I literally cannot scan the code from 2 meters away.

The QR code is text containing NZCOVIDTRACER:  followed by a JSON containing address, venue name etc. perhaps there is another format that can cut down on the ""s but I doubt there are other formats that can reduce the data stored in the QR code while maintaining backwards compatibility with older versions of the app.

It is also sad I cannot manually input the data from another QR scanning app, as I've had more success scanning the codes with other apps.

 I cri. We've been complaining about the cost to our provider (Mercury) . We got refunded once in 2019 when the estimate is waaaaay higher than the actual usage on the meter. Then for a few months it was reasonable and now it's back to the 100's.

We also asked our property manager about it thinking that there might be something that's causing the high power bill (like an old appliance or something)  and they said it's our problem to resolve with the provider 😩. We don't even use heating and we got no airconditioning. We freeze to death or just melt. Hahaha.

They do a great job of diverting salvageable items from landfill, offering a discount on the cost of dumping waste if you have anything they can sell or upcycle. Plus, anything you buy from there will also earn a per kg discount on the cost of dumping waste.

Based on your list I guess most op shops would throw most of your donations away. Well, their throwing-away protocols are pretty random - solely based on the personal taste of managers or experienced vonlunteers such as my partner. Sometimes you could even find decent/brand new products in their dumpster trolley. But still here are some universal rules to follow:

Op shops don’t like bulky donations. In fact most of them are struggling with storage so they strictly control the size of goods. How bulky is bulky? It depends. Generally for homeware category, your pillows, duvet inners, most blankets or similar shts are most likely to be thrown away, unless they are brand new or nearly brand new. You can think about value-size ratio. A washing machine is bulky, of course. A pillow is not as bulky as a washing machine. But they can sell the washing machine 20x more than the pillow with a 6x more storage size. So the value-size ratio is much higher for a washing machine.

Some people may deem op shops are generally for low-income people so they think ‘oh yeah they don’t care’. No! Middle-class people like us go to op shops regularly to discover interesting and bargain shts as well. So op shops still control quality, especially when it comes to hygiene-related stuffs. Most likely your bed sheets, towels, unused underwear, T-shirt would be thrown away. Come on. We all think that our shts are pretty clean. Like me, whose friends nickname me ‘neat freak’, whose sheets and towels are always spotless. But let’s be honest, my shts are still most likely to be dumped if I take them to an op-shop. They are just another guy’s old and useless stuffs.

Anything sharp or posing potential health & safety issues. This varies a lot as well. You’d better to check if your local op shop sells sharp things like knives/scissors. Some op shop would directly throw sharp items away but some don’t. Also they don’t like heavy things e.g. dumbbells, cast iron decorations etc because they may pose risks to workers/volunteers.

Anything dirty or looks dirty or they think it might be dirty. Of course no one wants dirty things. Somebody gives her white but pretty dusty curtains to my partner’s op shop and you guess what? She sneezed so much and directly dumped it. Or things like your old fabric shts which, well, is washed every week and deemed it’s clean by you. Sorry, it looks old and dirty. Go to dumpster.

Most decorations with tiny flaws. People always buy those shts from Typo Home Bed & Bath or Briscoes then we always find tons of similar decorations at op shops. But trust me those ones you can find on shelves are already very lucky items. Most decorations people donated have some flaw or just dusty. Even tiny flaws can lead to being thrown away, and op shops won’t clean these shts for anyone. They are super busy and always short of hands. They tend to keep valuable, delicate and smaller items. Again, it is about value-size ratio.

At the end I apologise for not giving you very precise guidance of keeping/not keeping which. But I think you could guess based on the above description. I’m very cynical when it comes to selling/donating goods in our society. Cos it’s all the consequence of consumerism. And I pretty much hate it.",1610655548.0,2021-01-15 09:19:08,/r/auckland/comments/kx2qrv/anyone_worked_at_an_opshop_can_tell_me_what_they/gj9kdwk/,3

So many people just have no idea about apartments and are commenting based on their perceptions and not from experience or any position of authority.

If you buy a shitty old shoebox apartment in Auckland CBD then yes, you can expect it to be a shitty experience.

If you buy a new (2016+) apartment then you will likely be fine. Body corporates aren't necessarily some nefarious entity that is stealing your money and spending it in secret. I didn't attend any body corporate AGMs but paid attention to news and read the minutes. I lived in a largely owner occupied building - it is the owners on the body corporate and the owners that make the decisions. In this day and age, a certain portion is squirreled away for long term maintenance. If you buy new and sell out within a decade then you won't have to worry about any of that.

5382,Is it better to buy a new townhouse or apartment (as a first home buyer)?,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_kwymza,gjari4g,SunriseOverSeaa,"My partner and I put an offer on a brand new 4 year old apartment before we found our home. Fortunately, our offer wasn't accepted. The reason why the people were leaving was they had a young baby and found apartment life limiting for the development of their child... no yard and high staircase etc can be a bit challenging for a toddler. We really liked the modernity of the apartment and how it utilized upwards space which a house doesn't do. It was very flash too. Our offer on the apartment fell through. At the time I was guttered, but I believe that it wasn't meant to be ours and I know now that we are way better suited to a house and yard arrangement rather than apartment life.

We don't currently have kids but we have a dog, and we were stoked that we ended up buying an older house that has been renovated with modern interior with a small yard as it would suit our future desire for a family plus it has more room for our dog. It still had the luxury of being modern but it has the cozy factor that the modern apartment didn't have. Apartments are awesome for couples and singles and professionals who are wanting a really simplified space that is a bit luxurious and doesn't come with it any extra stuff that drains time and energy for maintenance.

In our situation, the apartment would have been over 10k more than what we ended up spending on our home and yard - we are far happier to save money and gain on space and value, but this is not everyone's desire or need!

Which brings me to my main points to consider if you are wanting to figure out what kind of home would suit you best to buy. Think about:

\- location: where do you want to live? what's on offer? what's the best value for money that meets your needs? how much of a commute would it be from work? do you want to be in a specific school zone for future reasons? is there public transport handy?

\- what are your future plans? what kind of home would suit you best within the time you expect to live there?

\- do you want it to be new so that you don't have to do renovations to feel comfortable? do you have time or passion for doing the garden, lawns etc and outdoor work if you have a house with a yard? are you willing to pay extra for an apartment even though you could get more space with a home and yard situation for less (depending on the area of course)?

\- are you planning to stay there long term (5-20 years) or short term investment to renovate and flick? an apartment from what I know may not increase in price the same way a house and land could over the same amount of time, depending on whether you are able to give it a point of difference with renovations... are you guaranteed to make a profit if you did you renovations basing that on how much you invest into that?

\- are pets/kids/partner a hope for your near future? what kind of home would suit you if you're life included these things while you were still in your home.

\- last thing: what do you actually want / and or / see yourself living in? What aspects are you looking for?

We were looking in one specific location, we had a specific amount in mind that we wanted to spend, we bought a house knowing we wanted the potential of being able to pay it mostly off one income in the future so we could have more freedom for how we raise a family so that was a huge influence on what we planned to spend, we wanted a small yard, a fully fenced section, somewhere with privacy, somewhere modern enough to be comfortable and not need any work done, we made sure the house we bought was well kept and had no issues in the drains and structure of the home from the builders reports and drain checks, we wanted a bathtub and I wanted a beautiful functional kitchen, we also bought a 3 bedroom but it has an extra room as they built a conservatory on so we got bang for our buck and it had some cool quirks plus my partner is stoked it has a full modern garage space that had full shelving and gib board internally. We are also really close to a great park for walks and within walking distance to dairy / fish n chips / dominos / supermarket, ya know, all the essentials haha. We basically won the lotto on what we found in the end - it took us a year to find the right place and it was worth the wait to have all the above wins.

Good luck and hope this helps you figure out what to hone in on!

Edit: we aren't in Auckland but are in NZ so even if the price stuff is different hopefully the tips are helpful. Haha!

I’m about to start the two-year Masters at UC and have just done postgrad psych study at Massey (admittedly not the same subject but I believe they are part of the same broad department?) I know of three people who did the four-year programme at Massey within the last 5 years and all of them had great experiences. From what I understand, the Masters programmes (UC and UoA) are fundamentally four-year programmes delivered in half the time which is why there are such stringent entry requirements. At UC the bachelors and masters students are in the same lectures but have different assessment requirements. I have been told that the first year of the Massey undergrad is quite general and it’s not until second year that you start your practicums and more specific courses. UC, Massey and UoA see each other’s students as building towards one big, cohesive workforce and there really isn’t any hiring preference for one uni over another. Bacherlors students seem to come out feeling more prepared than Masters students but I guess that’s to be expected when you’re studying for twice as long haha. Cohorts are small everywhere - my MSLP cohort has 20 students and the last of my friends to complete the Massey Honors programme had a graduating class of 11 (they started with a few more but some dropped out).

* Buying a house is expensive

Good bits:

* Beaches a few minutes drive
* Good people
* The climate and the weather
* Lots of parks and green spaces

Here's some basic maths for the council... 10,000 people who want to make some noise about the harbour and the people who follow them without knowing or thinking about the actual social and economic consequences to the city, don't make a mandate and shouldn't be making the decisions.

Decisions like this should be made based on a carefully planned long term strategic decision.

How about you stop spending millions of ratepayers money on shrinking every arterial route to create cycle lanes that most cyclists refuse to use and put all that money into subsidising public transport so it actually shows up, doesn't skip stops late at night, runs past midnight, runs via schools around 8am and 3pm... So its an actual viable option.

Start building a harbour crossing, its been designed at least three times at ratepayers expense.. Some of those designs were based on tunneling up to and out from the tank farm that the council has now recently covered with apartment blocks (resulting in huge disruption and additional costs far beyond what has been earnt buy building apartment buildings on them).

It's as strategically stupid as building northern bus routes without planning for future rail on them when a harbour crossing is added, building low cost housing without parking, to encourage people to use public transport that largely doesn't exist and conveniently  ignoring the fact that it excludes anyone in the household from a career in trades, sales or working in most of the industrial areas that have virtually no public transport).

Stop lying to the public by splitting off watercare charges and then telling us our rates haven't gone up (because you split something out of them). Comparing our cycling infrastructure to dead flat cities with great public transport already in place, allowing developers to lobby you into lower consent fees, when they make massive margins and then charging all the ratepayers more to expand infrastructure because of the additional load of infilling. 

We struggle to pay our rates in this city... Be thoughtful and responsible for every dollar you spend, we worked hard for it.

Don't sell any asset that makes a profit and decreases the ratepayers burden.

Think longer term, the costs of infrastructure, tunnels and roads decreases over time with inflation...the councils delays have cost us billions.

... Just saying... Focus on what really matters please!

... And if your one of the many that continue to down vote this, grow some balls and explain your logic in a comment, so we can have a civil debate. 

For the record, I do support cycle lanes (AFTER public transport is working well), public transport and protecting the harbour, but I am also a pragmatist, acknowledge the city is a port city, there is no viable alternative logistics option nearby. 

I don't live in a fantasy world where I will bitch about not having a stadium downtown then complain when everything becomes more expensive or the social mayhem of ripping one of the largest business generators out of the city and filling the overcrowded motorways noth and south with trucks.",1610326770.0,2021-01-11 13:59:30,/r/auckland/comments/kum4u9/if_the_ports_of_auckland_were_moved_what_would/gitlbs7/,2

Unfortunately, what may be right for one person, may not be for someone else. So it’s hard to recommend someone for you. But rest assured that most, if not all, are trained to deal with anxiety, depression, mood swings, spiraling thoughts etc. 

My therapist is on a maternity break for a few months, otherwise I would recommend her to everyone.

1. The development is located pretty close to the Hibiscus Coast Bus Station - looks like a 10 minute walk (or a quick bike or scoot). As at 3:27pm on a Saturday Google Mapa tells me from the station to Britomart is 47 minutes on the  NX1 service. Setting arrive at Britomart by 9am on Monday is 51 minutes station to station.

2. It is otherwise very close to the motorway so you're not going to get bogged in as much local street traffic as someone on, say, the Whangaparoa peninsula. 

3. Floor plan looks very bog standard. For a 4 bedroom, conceivably 2 parents and 3 kids so a family of 5, the kitchen/dining/living area doesn't look very big. It's got the bedrooms and bathrooms but this very much looks like a no frills house.

4. Renders can be very misleading but it looks like on street parking is minimal. Single car garage could make things interesting in a house this size, especially if the whole street has similar houses. What if mum and dad both need a car for work? What about teenage kids when they get a car? 

5. Looks like building will be completed this month. The whole development looks like it will be pretty big (appears to be the first stage). Lots of construction still to come. 

6. Chinese developers. I am personally wary of these as I believe they are only in it for the money and if things go wrong they may bail and homeowners are left with minimal recourse. That's not to say it doesn't happen with Kiwi developers but just my opinion.",1610159897.0,2021-01-09 15:38:17,/r/auckland/comments/ktawen/bob_might_need_a_dictionary_for_his_next_caption/gim548d/,14

225 square meters is also a large house. This is a good price in today’s market.

There are so many important considerations:

Are you home all the time? Will the dog be able to cope on its own? How much exercise will it need? Are you going to be able to walk it every day? How much stimulation will it need? How do you plan to train it as a puppy? What are the health complications of the breeds you are looking at? What will you do with the dog when you go on holiday? Does the dog shed a lot of hair?

There are so many adult dogs out there in need of a good home and lots of rehoming agencies, e.g Huha, if you google it.  A puppy is cute but it's a lot of work and they grow up quickly.",1610179042.0,2021-01-09 20:57:22,/r/auckland/comments/kswbzd/wanting_to_adopt_a_beagle_puppy/gimylkf/,5

Get a damp facecloth, or any kind of cloth and put it on your chest, or face when you’re sitting down. It will likely get warm quite quickly, swing it around to cool it. Wrap ice in it if you really need cooling.

Run cold water over your hands, and feet if you can, you loose a lot of heat through them. Also your head.

If you’re having trouble with heat at night, have a short, cool shower before you got to bed.

Wear loose clothes, check out athletic ‘cool’ shorts and tops. There is some stuff out there that is really cool. Also saw some cooling sunscreen in the supermarket.

If you can open windows at night, and early morning, it will help keep the house cool the next day.

If particular rooms get extra hot, keep internal doors closed.

- get a damp face washer (or tea towel, in a pinch) and pop it in the freezer for an hour or so. Then, move it over your body. I find across my forehead/eyes and temples, and my inner arms/wrists (at your pulse point) to have the biggest impact. Repeat as necessary. 
- As others have said, keep blinds/curtains closed during the day. Fans are great if you don't have access to an air conditioner: if you have two, point one out the window to stop hot air coming in. 
- Re: fans, you can also put a bowl of ice in front of one so the cold air will be pushed around the room. 
- Have a cool shower just before bed, don't dry off completely, and sleep naked. Sleeping naked is better for temperature regulation. 
- STAY HYDRATED. Seriously. If you think you've had enough water, have a bit more (and periodically throw in a juice/Gatorade if you're sweating a lot). Lots of heat-induced headaches are actually dehydration, plus you can handle it better if you're hydrated.

The New Zealand photography facebook group is an alternative but you don't really make much more money as buyers expect a discount on Trademe prices. So, a camera that sells on Trademe for $3000 might sell for $2800 on the Facebook group, meaning you pocket about an extra $100.

To make that extra money you will probably have to wait longer to sell the camera as there are a lot less buyers, you are also a lot more likely to get dicked around as most Trademe buyers are very protective of their feedback reputation.

Personally, I would never use the facebook group to buy and sell camera gear, as i just don't think it is worth the extra hassle.

Alternatively you could try paying a Thai student to teach you the basics then practice with you an hour or two each week, meanwhile you learn more advanced stuff online/youtube and go over it at practice sessions to correct anything.

I didn't go to Bangkok for long so beyond that the only two pieces of advice I can give you is if you do go to Thailand don't go places with Thai friends all the time, other Thai people will ignore you and talk to them instead to save time and difficulty so you can't practice, and also when I got my pronunciation right it's only ever when I didn't overthink it, the moment I started thinking about it I got laughter in response.",1609917507.0,2021-01-06 20:18:27,/r/auckland/comments/krg9jr/thai_classes/gia59dj/,1

It is seen as more prestigious than AUT as it has a higher university ranking. AUT does have just as many facilities for students and just as good teachers. AUT is also far better integrated into industry with scholarships and internships. If you want a job directly after finishing a Bachelors then its certainly worth looking at AUT. They are much better at practical sort of things. 

Although it is a very common to think that the only reason that someone would go to AUT is if they can't get into Auckland. 

But you also have to look at it from specific majors. I think Auckland does suck at some things that AUT is way better at. For compsci, maths and marine biology, medicine Auckland is far far far better. But maybe for practical things AUT is better. Things like vettting and random smaller stuff it might be better off going to wellington or otago because auckland and AUT don't offer them. 

Philosophy is pretty good though at Auckland.",1610267776.0,2021-01-10 21:36:16,/r/auckland/comments/krcvdy/whats_the_physiothery_degree_like_at_aut_and_what/giqwsjp/,1

As a landlord it's my responsibility to make everything clear to the tenant how things work with the property including utilities. If the landlord wasn't happy with your Internet provider situation they should have issued a notice to remedy if they believed you breached the agreement (by ""changing the provider""). Similarly if you've been forwarding the bill to them, and they refused to pay, you should have issued a notice to remedy the breach of the agreement. Hindsight is 20/20, I know.

Ultimately its up to you if you want to go to the tribunal, in many instances the threat or application to the tribunal alone will be enough for them to budge without even needing to go (I did this a few years ago in an apartment I rented as the tenant, by applying to the tribunal they budged and I withdrew my application). Especially if the payment amount you're asking for isn't worth their time and effort of having to actually attend a hearing AND the risk they may have to pay extra costs ontop of the Internet bills. HOWEVER, this will put you on ""a list"" for being an ""annoying tenant"", at the very least on this property management companies list. Also they may not give you a favourable reference for future properties - just things to consider all in.

As an aside, it's complete BS that if you fight for your legal rights as a tenant that it can jepordise your future ability to rent.

Edit: again, INAL and if you push it, there's of course a chance the tribunal sides with the landlord. But from my experience having been on both sides of the fence, the tenant usually is favoured with tribunals.",1609815207.0,2021-01-05 15:53:27,/r/auckland/comments/kqj6pr/rental_contract_included_internet_not_reimbursed/gi51o0h/,5

2) Suggestions about contacting clubs are good as they may be able to help with beginners courses, advice on gear and perhaps direct you to members who want to sell gear. Most important you have people to go out on the water with (safety).

this article is skirting pretty close to the whole issue around the media publicising suicides. in fact it isnt even really skirting it, its trying to turn these sad instances into an intriguing mystery. This pisses me off because this whole article is essentially an ad saying ""want to kill yourself and be part of a great mystery? heres a great article about it! see you at the bottom of the cliff, big manhunt and mystery guaranteed!""

I mean i would expect a little bit of journalistic integrity, except the people who wrote this are hounding family members of suicide victims decades after the event for a story so we are already dealing with the lowest scum available.

also... the 6 month investigation has turned up what? a couple of old boys in a small NZ town saying ""yeah nah theres more to it"" wow shocking. they also managed the classic ""she wouldnt do this"" from distraught family members who theyve dragged through this shit all over again im sure.

other than that theres nothing. 6 months of investigative journalism to turn up with 2 naysayers and some distressed family members? wow excellent work.

Other than battery health, hybrids are just the same as a normal car so the AA inspection would cover the majority of that stuff anyway. 

If you're buying from a dealer then you should be covered under consumer rights for 28 days (I think?).

Any suggestions from where should I get the battery check and things to consider/ check before purchasing a hybrid car?",auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_konj9x,ghshw4t,rhododendronz,"Hey there, 

I bought a Toyota Aqua a couple of days ago. Here's what I learned about hybrids while searching:

- Unsure about the Insight, but Aqua/Prius batteries seem to require replacement after a minimum of 8 years or 150,000km. Battery wear is always greater the more the vehicle is used, but be aware that they do degrade over time to some extent even when not used. I have heard reports of Priuses getting up to 300,000km before a battery replacement is necessary, however. 

- Again not sure about the Insight but for my car a HV battery replacement should cost up to $3k. 

- ~~If the HV battery is dead, a hybrid vehicle cannot run. It's a slow death however, so you will know something is up well in advance when the car starts running sluggishly.~~ Apparently this applies to Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive vehicles (series-parallel hybrid) but the Insight uses Honda IMA technology (parallel hybrid) and should still be able to run without the HV battery, albeit not very well. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Parallel_hybrid.

- Do get a pre-purchase inspection that checks the battery health. If it is in good shape then you should be fine for the next few years but be aware that standard comprehensive vehicle insurance does not cover premature battery death as it's considered wear and tear. You need mechanical breakdown insurance if you want to be covered for that. 

- If you're buying from a private seller, you're not covered by CGA unless you can prove the seller lied to you about the vehicle. If buying from a dealership, you will be covered for 28 days (and in rare circumstances with really severe faults this may be up to a year, but best not to rely on this). 

- I got mechanical breakdown insurance through the dealership which covers the battery and other faults w/ roadside assistance for 3 years. It cost me $1200 and includes 3x service and WOF (you have to service the car regularly to be covered). Cost will again depend on the car, I'm not sure what they would say for a 2010 vehicle (for reference mine is 2017 with 25000km)",1609557429.0,2021-01-02 16:17:09,/r/auckland/comments/konj9x/kia_ora_aucklanders_im_planning_to_purchase_honda/ghshw4t/,20

A Question for people who live or have lived in the CBD...,auckland,t5_2rd5j,t3_koslf5,gi6puqq,muchmorthanthis,"I live in an apartment eden cres, top of shorthand st , opposite law school  its usually pretty quiet apart from the odd loud exhaust from those that have small dicks and heavy shoes, the chopper flying to the hospital early hours and the rubbish truck doing its vital job @5am the  party drunks walking home and the odd argument from  the bully who beats his wife,  the mental health  clients and drunken street people who reside in the oceanic hostel on Anzac Ave , I'm surrounded by over 400 people I estimate and generally they all pretty quiet the Asians are the most respectful and mindful,  very quiet the overseas residents who come stay are noisey as F..k , nothing that a shut the F..k up at 2am genraly they get the idea and quietian . 
I been residing in the same studio apartment now 12 years,  I love it and have no plans in moving anywhere .. City apartment living and community is the best move ever... Go for it .. get involved meet and greet and jump in boots and all you will enjoy it nothing like waking to rhe smell of different ethnic cooking ,diesel and roasting coffee hearing the odd argument or the sound of copulation its all part n parcel to city living ...on the other hand you could live in the burbs and listen to loud traffic noise pollution , and my pet hate the dreaded lawn mower all weekend ....my preference hands down the city its generally pretty quiet , just pick a good location away from the clubs which there really onl based up k rd now so there you go my honest opinion hope this helps seal the deal  and makes you make that leap of faith .. good luck and all the best for 2021",1609860020.0,2021-01-06 04:20:20,/r/auckland/comments/koslf5/hey_guys_a_question_for_people_who_live_or_have/gi6puqq/,2
