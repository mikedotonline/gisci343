I lost an ATM card a while ago called the bank and was told ""you can order a new one online"" in the app. I was relieved because nobody likes unnecessary branch visits right ? Anyway new card arrived ten or so days later and I thought nothing more really as this acct. had next to no money in it. Turns out the thief found my old card and had been trying to use it daily but declined many many times. Then one day some money comes in from overseas. Christmas day for the thief. When I was at work more than 1400 nzd ""paywaved"" from my account mostly booze shops and supermarkets in the city and newmarket.

So I just wanna give people a heads up please double check your old card is cancelled when you order a replacement. Fortunately my bank (WP) was really great about this and they refunded all the money within 48 hours. 

According to police this happens from time to time. I had a positive id on the thief but police refusing to chase as ""competing priorities"" currently according to email

Lately, I've felt my meditation practice has been slacking and not really feeling energised during the sessions. I think meditating with a group may help me in this area. Also, I would like to meet more likeminded people. I've found that when I attend other meditation/ spiritual discussion groups the demographic tends to skew towards people in their 40s and upwards. Ideally, I would like to be with people around my age (late 20's).

Even if there aren't meditation groups, I'm also interested in attending meet ups that hold spiritual/ philosophical discussions and maybe a buddhist way of life. 

Or maybe if there isn't one we could start one?! I'm really looking to make new likeminded friends, the most recent lockdown has got me feeling a little friendless lol.

Any recommendations/ suggestions would be most appreciated :)"

Recent public Council documentation from the Watercare development in the area has found Kauri Die Back throughout including on the gravel road. The road currently has many puddles and does not have cleaning stations or any infrastructure to protect spread and is signposted as leash only for dogs. Many Stuff runners and walkers bought their dogs and left them unleashed. Overall, this will likely cause significant spread of the disease within the area and abroad.

It is a good story to highlight how irresponsible the Stuff media organisation is on the part of protecting our wildlife. Further if Stuff were at all doing their job, they would be fully aware of this information made public early this year. They actually should have reported on it as the track remaining open without sign postings, and the prospect of major construction works in the area all add up to some good controversy and reading material. ESPECIALLY given the amount of attention we are paying to Watercare at this moment. I could list the recent coverage on water shortages, leaks, salaries, Watercare advertising payments and rumours of corruption within Watercare to add to the saga. So, Stuff either suck at finding out Stuff, they don't care, or they are burying the story for some reason. You would hope that it is incompetence and neglect, not something worse."

She's timid, but will respond to and come to her name and will bark quite happily. She has knotted fur and is in need of a haircut. She's microchipped, desexed, but is not currently wearing a collar, apparently. ID: 133183

We have already done the following:

1. Contacted SCPA, local vets, Auckland council, and the pound

2. Walked the streets - searched three days running

3. Left toys out that are hers, near the house and a couple of streets away

4. Dumped flyers in mailboxes and called around to everyone nearby

I've also pulled up all the drainage covers on the streets nearby, and have just come back from wandering through the vineyard, around Lake Panorama, and the nearby reserves.

Lizzie is, as you can imagine, tiiiiiiny. She went missing from Henderson, on Brittany Drive.

So here's the situation.
I live in a rental that shares a fence with our neighbor.  We have had issues with the neighbor in the past around noise complaints (I'm a drummer, I play for maybe an hour at a time during daylight hours on weekends) and general shitty behavior from our neighbor telling us we should just move out because he doesnt like us, etc.

Well a couple months ago, my partner noticed this guy in our yard line-trimming the fence between our sections.

I confronted him and asked him to please not come on our section. He dismissed me and ran off to his place.


Well today I spotted him again on our side trimming the fence line.
I approached him and once again said to leave our property immediately. 

He told me the fence is not on the property line, so he has every right to come over and trim the yard up to the property line.

Is that the case?

In order to get to that section of yard, he has to walk down our driveway, past our cars and garage, in to the back yard to then trim the fence.
It's not like hes just jumping the fence, he is fully entering our section and walking a good 20-30m down the length of our section to trim this fence.
And he doesn't tell us he is doing it.  He sneaks over and hopes to get it done before one of us says anything.


We have a guy who mows our lawn, so it's not like it's getting overgrown... it's just not to this guys standard, apparently.

I know the borders are closed to outsiders right now, the only exception based on my brief research being international students who already held a Visa prior and need to finish their schooling. I don't know anything about the government/social politics/health care system there, so I'd like to ask the opinions of NZ citizens about whether you think **it is likely your government will open up borders by the end of 2021?** It seems you guys prioritize health and wellbeing above all, even with the financial hits the economy has taken from the tourism and post-secondary education institutions. Not sure if one would be able to obtain a study Visa and enter later on, so if anyone knows anything about that I would be glad if you shared.

**Secondly, how is the general situation and life going there in the city right now? Is everything still open and functioning relatively normally? How strict is lockdown and going out/venturing in the city with law enforcement?**

**Are high school students learning online and does it look like schools will resume back in person again by the end of this year if so? (I'm applying to the Education program so it would involve placement in a school)** 

**Are you guys still allowed to travel across the country and cross-islands at this time? How strict are the regulations with that?**

I'm a bit unsure of whether it'd be the best time to decide to study abroad, considering the general uncertainty with the pandemic. Especially since a main part of my reason for studying abroad would be so I can meet people, explore a new country, and have travel experiences. However if the situation is likely to get better by the end of 2021, since this will be for 2022, there might be hope - but as someone from a different country it's harder for me to predict how it is/would be there.

Thanks in advance!"

We signed up for Hello Fresh and have had 5 weeks of deliveries so far. Just the two of us, no kids, 5 meals a week. 

It‚Äôs been good to have a greater variety of meals than we‚Äôve been eating before which we‚Äôve enjoyed. The menus seem well balanced too and good at getting the veggies in. 

That said, some dishes also seem a bit samey too. I‚Äôve never grated so many carrots to add to dishes, for example, but that‚Äôs maybe because we‚Äôve also been overly narrow in our menu choices each week. We‚Äôve expanded from the obvious choices in the past couple weeks to mix it up a bit more.

Now we‚Äôve tried Hello Fresh and found the concept generally works for us, other than the obvious My Food Bag, keen to hear of other recommendations for smaller Kiwi companies who offer similar good quality meal kits (that also deliver to Auckland).

The short lockdown at the start of season 3 seems to have triggered something in me, and now I can‚Äôt figure out how to human.

The level 4 lockdown was pretty tough, admittedly. My partner got rather concerned when I started having bouts of hysteria, laughing and not being able to stop. But at least then I was busy with work, I had a bunch of games to play and hobbies to work on. 

Second lockdown was much the same as the first. I got to continue and finish my half-started projects from the first lockdown.

But now? We have hardly any work- COVID has finally impacted on us. Not sure when in the future we‚Äôll get more work, but at least my contract is being extended. If only because literally everyone else in my department is going on parental leave, so it‚Äôs just me and my boss. My games are no longer holding my interest. I don‚Äôt have any projects in mind. I‚Äôm finding it hard to concentrate on anything, start anything, do anything. And as a result, the days are dragging endlessly. What do you mean its only Tuesday???"

Looking for a slightly larger 2 bedroom place as we're currently paying 550pw for a \~45sqm 1 bedroom, which hasn't been ideal with us both working from home these days. Because we're WFH, we no longer need to be so close to the city.

I'd love to hear from anyone that is living/has lived in the Mt Albert area - I've had a look online and there's surprisingly not a heap of info from others living in the area.

From the research I've done, it seems to have several advantages over our current spot:

\- Money goes further for rent  
\- 2 train stations within walking distance  
\- 2 supermarkets within walking distance (NW + Paknsave)  
\- Butchers  
\- Community pool  
\- More walks, reserves, cycleways  
\- Closer beaches  
\- More food options in town centre  
\- Maunga within walking distance  
\- Streets seem more walkable, not severed by spaghetti junction  
\- 2x Mt Albert BBQ Noodle Houses, vs 0 in Eden Terrace

If anyone else has any insight into safety, good streets/streets to avoid etc I'd love to hear it. Cheers!"

However sometimes the beach I want to swim at is marked as safe, but the adjacent beach is marked as unsafe (for example Little Bucklands Beach and Big Bucklands Beach). This makes me wonder if I should actually assume the safe beach adjacent to an unsafe one is more risky than a safe beach where the adjacent beaches are also safe.

Sorry if this seems like a weird question.

For A3 or smaller we print using a Ricoh C5200s laser printer. These take A3 and A4 sheets but you can also cut to custom and print custom as long as its not bigger than SRA3. 

We have a range of paper weights and finishes, and also the option for you to bring in your own paper. Depending on the day and how the printer was feeling lol, stuff would come out really nice.  


Its just hard for me to believe that warehouse stationery was the best place around to get prints done. Like we don't specialize in this, we offer what I thought was just general printing services, but I had tons of artists come in over the years saying the quality was great. I always thought the prices were steep but i also met many that were happy with the price too.  


So, Artists of Auckland, where do YOU go to get your work done, is Warehouse stationery really the best option or are there places you go to get stuff done. I mean if WS is the best place for quality and price, then that's cool, but if there is somewhere better I'd love to know."

They were not a contact themselves. There are another 1236 **close contacts** of case J (they were reclassified on the 24th from casual plus) who visited Kmart. I don't know what the numbers are from Dark Vapes, KFC, Bunnings, Pak'nSave and all the other locations but I suppose it's likely to be thousands more close contacts.

While i'd like to believe they are isolating for 2 weeks as the government said, are their *entire families* isolating as a result of them visiting these businesses? Because that is the same situation that this latest case is in.

If the requirement is that all household members of close and casual plus contacts need to isolate, you're starting to talk about whole percentages of Auckland, 10's of thousands of people rather than just thousands. If 2 degrees of separation is not enough to break the chain, and we want to wipe out this virus, then with those numbers, it does require shutting Auckland down.

I feel sorry for this guy, and all the family members and household contacts of the Kmart shoppers, and Pak'nSave shoppers, MIT students ect. I don't think they deserve to be demonised. If my family member returned 3 negative tests prior to this outbreak I would have assumed that I also did not have covid and it wasn't in my home. 

This latest case has me revaluating how ""Safe"" I am as a 2nd or 3rd degree contact.

Edit: I'm going to declare my self-interest in this. I work with, and am a close contact, of a casual-plus contact who visited Bunnings, who, like the highschool student has isolated and returned a negative test. I am in a similar situation to case M."

We're at the ""delusion"" stage of the housing bubble now. As the COVID vaccines kick in around the world, those who have come here from overseas will bugger off back to high paying jobs and they will be joined by our youngest and brightest who have been completely locked out of the Auckland house market - they'll go off to Brisbane, earn more and pay half the price for a better quality house.

We are looking at houses in the Otahuhu area. We use the train to get into the city. There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any parking at the station or near it
On surrounding streets.

I‚Äôm hoping others on here can share where they park durning the day.

Edit- the house we are looking at is at least 30mins walk from the station. We have a young child who will also come with us so we can drop her to care on the way. We do not think it‚Äôs currently feasible to walk to and from the station everyday. Thanks to people who‚Äôve PM with some suitable streets I appreciate the useful advice.

Hi, Hello, I'm back. Did we all enjoy our 3 days of social isolation?

Just rescheduling the meetup that I posted about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/leiw39/meetup_paradise_indian_buffet_wednesday_17th_feb/). Given buffet is no fun in Level 2 (they serve you food, you don't serve yourself), we will do this Wednesday the 24th of February if we are in Level 1 by then, or Wednesday the 3rd of March if not.

It's $22, it's all you can eat. It's going to be great food, great people. Come along - you know you want to.

Some meetup FAQs:

**I think I'm a social potato. Should I come to this meetup?**

Yes! This is exactly the meetup you should come to. Nobody cares if you want to stare silently at the wall, your naan bread or just talk to every single person at the table - it's all good. Not everyone's great socially, but if you are, awesome

**What is the age range of people at this meetup?**

Generally 20's to 30's, but sometimes 18 year olds show up, sometimes people in their 40s. If you're all good with the majority being 20's/30's, then come along

**I don't like Indian food, what should I do?**

Eat just the naan bread. It's amazing. And if you don't like the naan bread - sorry, you may be too far gone and there's nothing we can do to help

**The thought of walking up to randoms in a public space seems scarier than being victim in a shark attack - are there any solutions?**

Absolutely. Chuck me a PM. Myself, or someone else will come and find you and you can walk in with us. It's a lot less scary if you don't have to ask people if they're the anonymous people from the internet

**Can I bring my boyfriend/girlfriend/non-binary friend/mum/dog/other animal?**

Yes! Bring whoever you want. Probably don't bring pets. I don't think they're allowed inside

**I'm not available on this date, will you be doing another meetup like this?**

Possibly, but not likely to be anytime soon. The logistics of organizing a bunch of people who you don't know is quite the task

**I have dietary questions:**

[https://www.paradiseindianfood.co.nz/menu/buffet/](https://www.paradiseindianfood.co.nz/menu/buffet/)

**You didn't answer my question in this extensive FAQ. What next??**

Let me know by posting here or sending a PM. I don't bite (unless you have naan bread, I may fight you for it).

Hope to see you there :)"

Especially at the local Countdown, where I only saw three staff (out of about a dozen) wearing them. No checkout operators had them on, yet there was a notice for customers to be understanding and pack their own groceries. Um, why? If there is so little risk that they don‚Äôt need masks to protect themselves from me or each other, why is touching my groceries a risk? Groceries don‚Äôt cough.

I know they are mandated on public transport, but I kind of expected the majority of people to do as we did at the last level 3 and wear them. Especially the essential workers. Most customers were, though I noticed most people were not while out walking, running or cycling.

Was a bit surprised to be honest. At the moment we still don‚Äôt know where this latest outbreak came from.

Be interested to hear what‚Äôs happening elsewhere.

Staff at Harvey Norman click and collect were wearing them and had good safety protocols. The two other people collecting were not."

I‚Äôve gotten some really good insight on here in the past so I thought I‚Äôd ask regarding purchasing our first home.

We have pre-approval and a 20% deposit. 
We‚Äôve found a house we are interested in which is only being sold at auction. The bank has validated the property on their system and has said we can only bid to a specific amount. Anything above the bank‚Äôs authorised amount we would have to pay upfront in cash. 

The $$$ that the bank is happy with we consider to be significantly less than what this property will go for (and in this market is silly). And it‚Äôs noticeably lower than our pre-approval amount. 

What have other people done in this case?
Is this normal for a bank to limit the price you can bid up to even though they‚Äôve approved you for significantly more?

Thanks for any insight."

Basically I'm going into my third year of engineering and I have to decide whether I want to continue doing structural engineering papers or not.

I just want to say I would love to specialize in Transport, Environmental, Water and Geotech Engineering and would probably enjoy the papers maybe like 20% more than I would for structural but I am stressed about job opportunities for them in comparison to Structural Engineering.

I know I should pick the one I enjoy the most, but it's not that simple. Obtaining a job and having a stable salary is very important to me especially since I don't consider myself coming from a privileged background and that I am not entirely passionate about any of them so I would not mind picking one of the other if it helped my chances with financial stability.

I know this is really depressing and I know there are successful people out there with amazing jobs in each of those sub-specs but to be honest; I am an incredibly average person at best. I don't have amazing grades and I am also somewhat introverted with no connections in the industry. Last year I must have applied to at least 100 internships and didn't land any of them for the Summer so that's why I'm putting more of a focus into job opportunities and demand.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

What are the job opportunities like for each of the Civil sub specializations in New Zealand; Structural, Transport, Geotehcnical, Water and Environmental?

Is one superior than the other in terms of demand/pay?

Maybe some Extra Advice?

&#x200B;

Sorry I don't mean this to be a sob story but I just wanted to give an explanation why ""do what you're passionate about"" isn't enough for me anymore before people start commenting that.

Thank you for reading all of this I really appreciate it, I tried to make it as concise as possible without sounding like a robot. \^\_\^"

He does hard, grimy, dirty work while you get to stay home (nice and dry btw) and spend time with the kids. To think that you would consider doing that kind of work in the rain during a lock down instead of being with your kids is shameful!

Dont ever take for granted the time you have with your children... some of us have grown up without our parents even around. Some of us parents work very long hours, the only times we see our kids is early in the morning when we leave for work and they're asleep... and when we get home in the evening and they're asleep."

Since moving to NZ, I've struggled to find clothes that fit my small (155cm) frame. I've always had to cuff my pants or buy 7/8 length leggings, which end up looking full-length sized on me. Also, I'm a bit bottom heavy. So it's a double whammy for me. I have to look for pants that get past my hips, even though it looks a bit funny because the waist area bunches up, and then I need to have the excess length chopped off.

I don't want to have to always bring in my pants for alteration. Sure, the fit will definitely turn out way better, but it gets tiring and not to mention, bit of a blow to my wallet in the long run.

Assuming the idea is that the person obstructs the card reader from view using their body and the sound gives off the impression that they tagged on.

People still do stuff in real life, right??

Some of us are going to head to Paradise Indian Buffet on the 17th of February at 7pm. You should come too. The food is great, it's $22 for all you can eat. You get to meet some new people. It's a win-win!

Some meetup FAQs:

**I think I'm a social potato. Should I come to this meetup?**

Yes! This is exactly the meetup you should come to. Nobody cares if you want to stare silently at the wall, your naan bread or just talk to every single person at the table - it's all good. Not everyone's great socially, but if you are, awesome

**What is the age range of people at this meetup?**

Generally 20's to 30's, but sometimes 18 year olds show up, sometimes people in their 40s. If you're all good with the majority being 20's/30's, then come along

**I don't like Indian food, what should I do?**

Eat just the naan bread. It's amazing. And if you don't like the naan bread - sorry, you may be too far gone and there's nothing we can do to help

**The thought of walking up to randoms in a public space seems scarier than being victim in a shark attack - are there any solutions?**

Absolutely. Chuck me a PM. Myself, or someone else will come and find you and you can walk in with us. It's a lot less scary if you don't have to ask people if they're the anonymous people from the internet

**Can I bring my boyfriend/girlfriend/non-binary friend/mum/dog/other animal?**

Yes! Bring whoever you want. Probably don't bring pets. I don't think they're allowed inside

**I'm not available on this date, will you be doing another meetup like this?**

Possibly, but not likely to be anytime soon. The logistics of organizing a bunch of people who you don't know is quite the task

**I have dietary questions:**

[https://www.paradiseindianfood.co.nz/menu/buffet/](https://www.paradiseindianfood.co.nz/menu/buffet/)

**You didn't answer my question in this extensive FAQ. What next??**

Let me know by posting here or sending a PM. I don't bite (unless you have naan bread, I may fight you for it).

&#x200B;

Hope to see you there :)"

Instead of the fare drop for off-peak that was promised as a nice COVID outcome, fares will just mostly remain unchanged when travelling off-peak but hike 4% for standard fares.

Nearly $8/day to use public transport, not to mention anyone travelling more than 2 stages, is not an affordable public transport system. Fuck this, when is our city going to start future proofing away from outdated car-prioritised commutes? 

Even worse, how is it that the problem cited here is that MORE people are using PT, leading to the price hike? ‚Äú[AT chief executive Shane Ellison] explained that because of increase in transport use, that costs need to be hiked they pay for more services.‚Äù [source](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/backlash-over-auckland-transport-price-increase-petition-calls-for-freeze-on-fares/DNAU5A65NP3HVLVADQDULQLB3M/)

The main issue from a usability perspective is the extremely bumpy finish, rendering it the same, if not worse, than the adjacent root damaged footpath. From a safety perspective, there is also significant concern regarding the unrestrained drop off both sides of the path.

There is already a pretty lively discussion about these issues in an earlier post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/ky56qf/t%C4%81maki\_drive\_cycle\_path\_is\_this\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/ky56qf/t%C4%81maki_drive_cycle_path_is_this_it/)

Since then, numerous articles by NZ Herald have been published, however they are all pay-to-read.  That leaves most of us with a general question of ""what now""? As a daily user of the path, I would be really keen to know what AT propose to do about it and critically, when? There are several posts referring to their response as 'its still under construction, so user-beware'. 

Sorry, but this is unacceptable. The presence of the path and the now restricted road lane width, means as a cyclist you are forced to use it. Using the road lane is not possible unless you can maintain 35-40kmh for about 2-3km (as most cars do not sit at 30kmh posted sign, lets me honest).

I'm just trying to remember some of my favourite dishes. Beef & BlackBean with Rice noodles, Portuguese style baked chicken, Chicken Cutlet with blackpepper sauce, chicken & cashews, etc 

The cuisine seemed to be Cantonese, but I'm not an expert in this area.

My Fianc√© (28M) and I (23F) are not in a financial position to buy a house, we will be in the next 5-10 years if we keep our spending to a minimum and look at modest houses. 


My dream would be a single story, two-bedroom, with hard-wood floors. I have never been interested in huge houses.


Fiance's Mum is in her 60s, recently divorced, she has been diagnosed with depression and is lonely. She says she is depressed because she went from living in this beautiful house to a tiny rental. My FIL has a 30 year mortgage in his 60s, the repayments are close to bankrupting him, but he won't leave his home so he bought her out. She has this money, which I imagine is 500,000-600,000 NZD just sitting there. 


She is not happy with the houses in this price-range and has worked out that if my fiance and I buy a house with her, she can live in another 1.1mil house. She is insistent on buying in specific suburbs in auckland. I personally could live out west, nice area, more bang for your buck, real people, but she is a Shore-or-die kind of gal.This is an incredible opportunity for my fiance and I BUT I'm 23, I love my independence. 


When MIL first suggested the idea, she talked about a separate detached unit, but the houses she's showing us have granny flats which I know would be too small for her, we'd be in the same house, using the same kitchen etc. I'm also nervous because Fianc√© has a brother (20M) and there will be nobody to help HIM buy a house one day. 


How can I possibly tell my Fiance/ his mother that I may not want to do this? Or, am I being naive and should graciously accept MIL's generous offer to help us on the property ladder and help her own a home she feels more comfortable in? 


TLDR: MIL can buy a big house if we go in with her because she can't get a 30 year mortgage. I am looking for advice if it is wise or stupid for us to buy in with her. Any advice would be much appreciated."

Just looking for some advice. We had two giant 70+ year old pine tree cut from our property.   
At the time we didn't have the money to have the arborists take the giant slabs, so we thought to leave it, innocently thinking friends/family would want to cut it for their own firewood. 

  
Given that some of the slabs are huge, and can only be cut by special chainsaw (about 1.5m deep?) we've exhausted eager friends/family who wanted them for firewood. 

  
Are there any companies in Auckland that would want them and would take them for free?   
Or would it be best to hire the arborists to come back and chop them all up as firewood to donate it or sell it? 

  
We thought about putting it on Trademe and telling people to grab whatever they want... but we want to avoid a large crowd of people on the property that might hurt themselves. 

There are some giant slabs, lots of branches, thousands of pinecones, and some small logs. 

Thank you in advance!"

My issue is I don't remember the location or the name of the restaurant and even an intensive Google search makes it seem like it's non existent. 



I'm sure we can somehow narrow it down to a couple of restaurants, these are my hints:

-The area was slightly industrial? Not City centre. Could've been somewhere out west-ish. 

-Right next to the imaginary restaurant was an Indian supermarket (which was down a driveway). 

-The restaurant was filled with dark wooden tables and large dark wooden chairs. It even had elevated areas where you can sit on a carpet and eat like you're sitting on the floor. 



It's definitely not the following:
-Shefco
-Des Traditions
-Pita House

Just wanted to ask the past or current students going to the University of Auckland Epsom Campus  on their opinions on it! (Im going to be applying soon) 
Are the students friendly there? Do people become friends easily? Hows the environment like? Hows the work and studies? 
(Im not sure if I should apply for the Epsom campus or the South Auckland one. I want to go to the one that has the most supportive environment.)

I'm glad I don't work in the area anymore so I don't have to go through it everyday. 

this site makes some proposals from 8 years ago to which I'm not sure how much has been done, nor do I think it fixes the fundamental problems of this roundabout: https://riverparkactiongroup.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/proposed-changes-to-universal-driveswanson-roaddon-buck-road-roundabout/

I really think the whole thing just needs to be gutted. Traffic lights could cause more traffic problems, but not sure what other solutions there are.  
One lane entering the round about from each side would also lead to traffic problems. 

The whole roundabouts a hazard.  I'd be interested if there were any stats on how many crashes have happened on it."

I moved to New Zealand in 2008 and I've lived in Auckland the whole time. Right after I moved here, one of the first kiwis I met (a lovely middle aged gentleman who helped me and my family a lot in our early days) gave us warning after warning about Boy Racers, telling us to watch out for them on the roads, telling us they are likely going to ruin our experience of driving around in Auckland, that they were a real menace to society, and that our lives would be in constant danger on the streets of Auckland. For the first few months of my time in NZ I lived in constant terror every time I needed to go anywhere by car because I was so concerned about getting run off the road by a fleet of these Boy Racers. Turns out it was mostly bullshit. Sure, over the years I've encountered some cars racing on the motorway (usually around midnight or so) but it's a fairly rare occurrence for me and certainly not something I spend a lot of my time worrying about lol. It got me wondering, was there actually a time (maybe before I moved here in 2008) when so-called Boy Racers *were* a big menace on the streets of Auckland? If so, what happened to them?

im not the best at explaining situations but basically there's this one point in a parking lot where there were originally two parking spaces opposite each other, but with a gap in the middle to let the cars drive through. however, seeing as these two parking spots were too close to allow cars to comfortably drive in between, the shop keepers around the area has painted a NP on one of the carparks to prevent people from parking there. the parking lines have already been painted over with black paint but with the colour difference, you can still clearly see the parking lines. people still park there from time to time despite the NP and makes it very difficult and sometimes impossible for cars to drive past.

[**https://www.cityraillink.co.nz/crl-travel-times#block-yui\_3\_17\_2\_12\_1491437396326\_4334**](https://www.cityraillink.co.nz/crl-travel-times#block-yui_3_17_2_12_1491437396326_4334)

Now based on the map shown, it looks like it may actually take longer to get to Britomart on the Southern Line with the new CRL changes? Or at least the exact same time.

Am I missing something?  


**Edit: I should have thought about this more before posting....**  


>The old map shows that it takes 70 mins to get to Britomart from Pukekohe.  
The new map shows that it takes 70 mins to get to Aotea. Then I assume another 3-5 mins to get to Britomart. So about 5 mins faster. That's at least something.

Very simple. Every time I see a Nissan Dualis, I look at its boot to see if the handle is taped on. If it is, I win... points, or something - I'm unsure. I haven't recorded any specific numbers, but I would say roughly a quarter of the drivers of this particular model are currently driving their car with gaffer tape on their boot handle. Clearly a design fault. I'm inviting all Aucklanders to take up the challenge and look out for taped Dualis boot handles. Anyone else been noticing this?

A car was going to fast too stop for the traffic in front of them and swerved off towards the Wellesley/Port exit and in the process straight across the front of another car.

I decided to stop even though I was late for work and see if I could help. Parked my car down the exit, as far onto the shoulder as possible and walked up to where they were stopped. The car that had done the reckless driving had it's back left wheel hanging pretty precariously and the other car had it's whole front end damaged where the instigator had dragged his vehicle across. As I was giving the second car my details, what really surprised me was the attitudes of people driving past.

A guy in an orange coloured wagon decided to call everyone ""fuckwits"" and yell at them to get off the road like some sort of enraged methhead while his girlfriend tried to hide her face in the front seat from embarrassment. And it then proceeded to continue along that ilk, with cars driving past and telling them they shouldn't be parked there, or shouting obscenities at the poor foreign family in the back who couldn't move their car around the front car with the busted tyre. It was pretty tough to watch, and I felt really embarrassed of my fellow kiwis.

General rule of thumb, if there are cars stopped on the motorway, they probably aren't there by choice. They are either broken down or they have had an accident. And that's probably a lot to deal with without a whole bunch of angry morning drivers taking their shitty lives out on them as they drive past like a bunch of traffic heroes. If any of you are here in this sub, you should be ashamed. Especially the burnt orange douchebag in the burnt orange car. You are the worst of the worst, you absolute minger."

As you walk to the venue, you notice that some people with utes or 4WD have parked on the grass. Also there are still people foolishly looking for spots in the best area. Some are lucky enough to get the right spot just as it opens up!

Finally as you leave the venue early to beat traffic, you see that the parking area you found is now full with punters looking for a spot. As you leave someone waits for you, just like before with the other area.

My thoughts so far are that they should gameify it. Something like 25 scans a month gets you bronze, 50 scans silver, 100 for gold. Alongside that, like a tamagochi we could have a picture (cartoon perhaps) of Ashley where the more you scan the happier he gets, and as time goes on if you don't scan he gets sadder. Maybe at minimum your get frowny Jacinda in the background and at maximum you get Jacinda with thumbs up photobombing Ashley.  
I am not sure they should offer cash prizes, but improved data collection reduces the time required and cost of contact tracing by people making phone calls.  
Not only would gameifying the app encourage use, but publicity around something like that might reach people who otherwise don't see ads.  
And although retailers have enough to deal with it would be nice if they could make a little more effort to encourage scanning. Offering an incentive to scan (5% off or something) might help, may even encourage customers to frequent ""safe"" stores.  
I was in a photography store and their QR code was just below my knee level, behind a tripod. Also, QR codes behind glass with bright sunshine behind you are an absolute pig to scan. Encouraging people to improve those would help. Even scan on exit is better than not scanning at all.  
ANYWAY - What do you think, might that help? Feel free to throw some ideas around. Let's see if we can find some ways to increase uptake and usage and get Ashley smiling again."

We are currently students looking to move into a property known as Harvard Apartments, however the company prefers we sign a fixed term lease. I am extremely worried about this as my previous flatting experience left me in a fixed term lease where I lost my job due to covid, and the appliances in the apartment began to break left and right, our landlord was refusing to answer, the tenancy tribunal was having trouble getting around a fixed term contract, legal help was scarce since I was a student, and I was trapped in this apartment I couldn't get out of and consistently paying money to a landlord who was not responding to any of our problems, and even sent random people in for our inspections who didn't know what they were doing. TL'DR, I got fucked over majorly. How do I make sure that this doesn't happen again?

Is there anyway to ensure that entering a fixed term contract is as trustworthy as it is? Are there any apartments that you could recommend or any tips for a new person moving out and how to safely accept a fixed term contract?

My electric scooter (Mi m365) was locked to one of the three bike rack next to the carpark entrance between 5pm - 5:40pm. When I came back outside with groceries, it was gone.

I made a police report and I spoke to the staff and they looked at the CCTV footage. *A guy wearing singlet and shorts ""broke off"" the bike lock and just rode off with it*. Sadly that's all the description I got since their CCTV is pretty far away and couldn't get any good look. Staff said they'll send the footage to the police with my ref number.

I know it's very unlikely I'll get it back. There's very little to go on and it's a very common scooter with no distinctive markings on it. In hindsight I should've save all the serial numbers, attached a GPS tracker on it, paint it or whatever.  I guess I need to rant. I've been feeling mad since yesterday and can't seem to focus on anything."

Because of the baby, I don't want to walk around in the city trying to find all the cafes. So just wondering if you can help me with some information :-D

1. Wondering if you know of any cafes with no more than 15 PCs/spaces?

2. Anyone knows if there are any rules or anything about drinking at Internet cafes? I guess it's the same as restaurants?

3. Anyone knows of any outdoor activities that are not too pricey? I was thinking a clay shooting, jet boat rides but they are prettttyyy pricey

I have a question regarding Consumer Guarantee Act. 

I bought a Black head remover from Dick Smith for my girl friend. She tried it and it doesn't remove any of those black heads, and also leave red bruises on her nose instead. We have read the manual and followed the instruction but it just doesn't work.

I tried to contact Dick Smith to return it and ask for a refund, but they said, and I quote.

""Due to health and safety regulations, we are unable to accept this product for return under the terms of our Returns Policy for ‚Äòchange of mind‚Äô purposes.""

What can I do in this situation? Am I the wrong here?

Hi there.

But I‚Äôm really grateful to them and now I‚Äôm more vigilant even if I know that my kids are sitting quietly I‚Äôll be more aware. I‚Äôm generally a really paranoid person I always think people are always watching or recording me when I don‚Äôt know them I get really anxious and paranoid and when they told me I did thank them but I was kind of shock at that time that I regret not walking up to their car and properly thanking those ladies for letting me know. I didn‚Äôt sleep most of the night just thinking about this whole incident as to how I didn‚Äôt notice and how I should‚Äôve been more aware and I feel so guilty and embarrassed and feel horrible. I also am very paranoid about being possibly recorded and people are gonna think I‚Äôm a horrible parent because I made that terrible mistake of not noticing. If any of you ladies that  followed me home that day see this please please get back to me and do come around you know where I live so I can properly thank you guys.

There's no love or pride behind it and you can taste it from the first bite.

Pretty disappointing given how popular fish and chips are in NZ and I've travelled a bit pre-covid to the UK/Europe and it was never much of a mission to find fresh chips from potatoes peeled in the back room.

Hoping there's a spot that you guys can recommend.

Hi there. So yesterday I was driving home and my kids were in their car seats but my younger daughter sometimes get nauseous in the car so she likes her window down a little and she must‚Äôve put her head out of the window at some point which I didn‚Äôt not see and now I feel gutted and guilty for not noticing, so anyway this group of ladies had been following me all the way home to let me know that my child‚Äôs head was  sticking out of the window and I really appreciate that they told me but I feel really guilty and embarrassed and feel let down as a parent as to how I did not see her doing that. But I‚Äôm really grateful to them and now I‚Äôm more vigilant even if I know that my kids are sitting quietly I‚Äôll be more aware. I‚Äôm generally a really paranoid person I always think people are always watching or recording me when I don‚Äôt know them I get really anxious and paranoid and when they told me I did thank them but I was kind of shock at that time that I regret not walking up to their car and properly thanking those ladies for letting me know. I didn‚Äôt sleep most of the night just thinking about this whole incident as to how I didn‚Äôt notice and how I should‚Äôve been more aware and I feel so guilty and embarrassed and feel horrible. I also am very paranoid about being possibly recorded and people are gonna think I‚Äôm a horrible parent because I made that terrible mistake of not noticing. If any of you ladies that  followed me home that day see this please please get back to me and do come around you know where I live so I can properly thank you guys.  And if anyone out here can please give me some advice as to what I should do because firstly I feel really guilty for noticing and secondly I‚Äôm really paranoid about being recorded.

Thank you"
